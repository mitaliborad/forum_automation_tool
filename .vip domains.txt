Topic: I have been following for the last few days, fake .vip sites are emerging that will rank higher than even .com domains that are fully compatible with high authority words. There is no previous traffic study or backlink on these sites. How do they get these sites to rank 1 in 1 day?

I think it comes down to black hat tactics. Whether it is applied on .vip or .com . The strategy behind it is more important that .vip

Yeah, I’ve noticed that too! It’s likely a mix of black-hat SEO tactics—things like expired domains with existing authority, aggressive spam backlinking, or even hacked sites redirecting traffic. Some might also use cloaking or manipulative CTR techniques to trick search engines. The real question is how long they stay at #1 before Google catches on. Have you seen any stick around for long?

Topic: Do a WHOIS reverse search, you will be shocked how many marketers and creators have multiple domains and have new tld bought. But they use these new tld domains for redirect to their Main .com site.

Often people like Bloomberg have numbers in their domain, the same. numbers like 360, also 360bloomberg(com), they using numerology,

I use numerology check too with my domain names, but not kabbalah or indian veda no, much older and more accurate.
