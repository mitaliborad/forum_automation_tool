I’m on the lookout for a crypto payment gateway that lets clients pay in crypto, and allows us to withdraw the funds directly to our cold wallet—no fiat and no KYC process.


Ideally, we’d love something that just needs an email for setup and withdrawals, without any complicated verification steps. And of course, the lower the fees, the better!


If anyone knows of a platform that fits this, I’d really appreciate your help and recommendations!


Also, it should work with WordPress websites if possible.


Thanks so much in advance!

i used it a while back but it was pretty buggy. Seems there have been improvements though and second person today that has suggested it.
