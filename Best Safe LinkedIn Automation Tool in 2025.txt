Topic: Hey maybe it's a famous set up but since i don't see reply maybe it can help you :

So here is the set up I currently use :
- find your perfect clients : LinkedIn Sale navigator (free month and then after it's 50% OFF if you ask for a refund because their service is too expensive)
- scrap your list and then export it to XLS : Lemlist (EvaBoot works great and PhantomBuster also)
- Enrich your list w/ emails + phones : BetterContact OR Lemlist, both works great
- Automate your Sendings on mail, phone calls and linkedin : Lemlist (never tried the other cold outreach apps so can't really tell you)

PS : Wait 2 to 3 weeks on Lemlist with something called Lemwarm in order to not land in spam

So it's a $300-$400 month but you get it back with one client closed sooooo
