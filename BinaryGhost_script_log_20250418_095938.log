2025-04-18 10:03:13,116 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Hey everyone, I’m new here and just starting to explore a few ways to make money on Instagram. Still early in the process, just testing things out and trying to learn what works.
Is anyone here actively running multiple Instagram accounts without getting stuck in action blocks or constant verifications?
I’ve been testing a setup for a mix of meme pages and small niche store accounts. The goal is to scale up gradually, nothing too aggressive, but I keep hitting random limits even when I’m not doing anything that looks spammy. Some accounts post fine, others get restricted for basic stuff like following or liking. I’ve read a lot of mixed advice. Some people say running accounts through a browser with proxies is totally fine if you keep things separated. Others say that only physical devices or emulators work long-term and anything browser-based will eventually get flagged. It’s hard to know what’s actually working right now.
If you’re managing multiple IG accounts daily, I’d really appreciate any insights.
What setup are you using? Are you mixing tools, phones, browser profiles? And how are you keeping your accounts from triggering blocks?
