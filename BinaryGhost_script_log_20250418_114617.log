I'm surprised that MySpace still has a section in Blackhat World. MySpace died since the rise of Facebook by the end of the 00s, and many people who are under 20 right now, they're not aware of its existence.

So the question is, how someone can make money out of a music news site this year? Because that's what MySpace is now. A music news site.
