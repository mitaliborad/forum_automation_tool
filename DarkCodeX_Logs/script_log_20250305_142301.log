I am still trying to find reliable payment service that i can work with them . I have tried everything . I have bought moyi cloak , it doesnt work for me . Tried with paypal / stripe cloaks , just doesnt work , they still manage to find its me and insta ban my account on first order . If i have to use stripe again i might only buy stealth with ready cloak and i need help with that. Otherwise i need a normal payment service that would help my website and business.
