Here’s the big news: I’m pregnant!

My husband and I are finally going to have a baby, something we’ve been eagerly waiting for. I came across a tool on Reddit that predicts what your baby’s face might look like, and I couldn’t resist giving it a try.


The result is so cute!
I hope my baby looks like this in 8 months. But of course, no matter what they look like, I’ll love them endlessly.

I’m filled with excitement and happiness. Wishing all of you the same joy and fulfillment in your dreams!
