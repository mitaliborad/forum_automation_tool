Tool should allow users to make fine-tuned edits to even the smallest details of the video, such as timing, transitions, and effects. Additionally, the AI should be capable of generating realistic emotions and expressions in characters, ensuring that the video feels natural and engaging.

The tool should also include high-quality audio generation that matches the emotional tone and context of the video, creating a seamless and immersive viewing experience.
