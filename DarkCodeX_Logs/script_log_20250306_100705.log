2025-03-06 10:09:39,440 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Hey guys!

my domain name (that's been registered with Namesilo) is up for renewal soon and I tried to renew it manually and - for the first time since I've used Namesilo (over 10 years now) - I was asked to enter in billing address and phone number which - as you all know by now - I HATE it! It's no one's business where I live or what my phone number is.... not to mention that I might not even have a phone to begin with (I do, but let's pretend that I don't ) so what then? I wouldn't be able to own a domain name just because I don't have a phone? That's stupid... well, I know about the "own nothing and be happy" agenda, but still....

Anyway, it's time for me to finally part ways with Namesilo so I need a domain registrar that's not so nosy, so can you recommend something?

When I tried to renew this domain in Namesilo I tried both the Credit Card option (which asked me for my address), but also I tried Paypal (which is what I used to use mostly when buying stuff online), but Paypal won't allow me to renew unless I enter in a phone number, so I guess it's time to part ways with PP too....

I know that the alternatives nowadays seem to be Porkbun and Spaceship / Namecheap, but I don't trust Namecheap and all of their other businesses (like Spaceship) because they've screwed me before, so I'd like to avoid them...

As for Porkbun, I don't know, I never used them before, and I wouldn't mind trying them out if - through some miracle - they managed to slip through the sausage fingers of the totalitarian oligarchs that rule this world, and not require KYC. But I don't know if that's the case, so those who use Porkbun, do let me know!

Besides Porkbun, what other domain registrar do you guys know of that lets me renew my measly $5 domain without wanting to know who I am, where I live, what I had for breakfast, the consistency of my poop, and wanting to take my DNA and blood samples? Any normal registrar left out there, or are they all compromised?
