2025-03-06 12:22:01,834 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Hello mates,

I own multiple high-risk e-commerce stores, including white-label, reselling, and dropshipping businesses in various categories such as IPTV, Vape, social media marketing, digital subscriptions, and more. I've built these over the past 8 years, and some are doing really well. However, I believe there’s still significant room for growth.

A few points I’ve encountered:

SEO Challenges: While I’ve secured backlinks from various sources, many have high toxicity scores, resulting in wasted investments.
Payment Gateway Issues: I’ve been struggling to find the right solution. Recently, I found Card2crypto, which works well for WooCommerce stores but has a low conversion rate for my targeted region.
I’m looking for:

New SEO techniques to improve my site’s performance that are still unknown to most
Alternative payment gateways that support card payments with crypto settlements
Suggestions for new niches to enter or profitable opportunities for white-labeling something .
your answer can be helpful to other fellow members also, Thank you
