I have a paypal account that I use to receive IPTV payments. Today it is suspended and asks me to provide:
Upload a photo ID
Provide proof of fulfillment
Provide proof of purchase from your supplier
Provide more info on your transaction(s)

How do I do this? Should I disguise the fact that it's IPTV, knowing that I have a dispute whose customer has mentioned that it's iptv?
