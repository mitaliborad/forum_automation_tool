2025-03-07 09:18:00,464 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Hi I've posted a thread earlier but wanted to give a quick review and create a new one.

My Goal is to have a system of Bulk SMS running through google voice accounts so I can promote affiliate offers.

1) I am using a VPN
2) I have 10 voice accounts
3) I have the numbers I need to message

The roadblock I am facing is that after I use account #1 and send 100 messages, I move on to account #2 and it stops me at 20 messages, I then move to account #3 and it stops me at 20 messages for the day. I want each account to be able to send out 100 messages each. Despite using a VPN, google is able to associate and create a link between the voice accounts. How do I overcome this? All the voice accounts are being logged into through one device - my computer (I feel that this is the only connection between the accounts that can be spotted).

What are the mistakes that I am making? Does anyone have experience doing this on a large scale? Please let me know.
