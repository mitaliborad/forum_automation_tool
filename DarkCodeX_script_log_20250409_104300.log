2025-04-09 10:46:58,077 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Hello,

I've been trying for a while to code a chaturbate viewers bot in python. I was successful and it was preatty easy with selenium headless to generate ~25-50 anonymous viewers, but this approach is not scalable.

I was trying to reverse engineer/crack the api calls that chaturbate does in order to record a new viewer. Like copying the cURL request from the network console in chrome and reproducing it in postman. It didn't work. Even exporting all the calls that chaturbatte is making when accessing a model page in to a HAR file and then manually executing that file from python didn't work.

They must create some sort of cookie that differentiate each user such that the request cannot be duplicated. I couldn't figure it out. If there's anyone who done this before can you help me with a hint?
