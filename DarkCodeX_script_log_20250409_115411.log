2025-04-09 11:56:06,397 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: For context, back in 2021, i was able to successfully bump my linkedin accounts via j.rvee on a virtual machine; residential proxies and all. I believe i had 10 linkedin accounts running at the same time and had their connections increase from 0 to 800 within months. But then something came up and i stepped off of IM. Now i'm trying to get back to it.

A few months ago i tried logging in to one of my linkedin accounts and i immediately got blocked. Linkedin was asking for id verification and now i am hesitant to login to the others for the risk of having all of my linkedin accounts getting blocked/banned.

Does anyone have any solution to this specific issue that i have? My intention was to be able to login to them and use them again for connections. I know that j.rvee is gone now so i intend to just add connections manually on my own. I wanted to make it right this time and not risk these accounts so i would like to ask for advises on the best practices. My device and IP is different now from what i had before. Also, as far as i remember i went into an extent to editing my browser's cookies via a browser extension whenever i login to a specific account but i forgot the practice now.

Thanks in advance to anyone who can share their expertise on this matter!
