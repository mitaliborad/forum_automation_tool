I have a movie website and I used to use doodstream and filemoon as my #1 and #2 player. However, after doodstream went down, I suddenly thought: Is it possible that Filemoon will also go down in the future? So now I want to ask you guys to recommend some hosting platforms that you feel are okay so that I can use them instead.
