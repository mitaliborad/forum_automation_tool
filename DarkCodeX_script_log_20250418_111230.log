2025-04-18 11:17:32,617 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Hi there,

I am managing two Australian Etsy seller accounts one which I have spent 1.5 years to build. If Etsy detects I am using proxies to manage them from Pakistan then the accounts will be suspended and all my hardwork of these 1.5 years will be gone. I have done research over how can different conventional proxies be detected by wesbites and I have come to he concusion that I will need static residential proxies that are sourced from home as they are the perfect fit for my case. Please advice.
