2025-04-10 11:18:29,003 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: I've noticed a big decline in my Onlyfans daily visitors since the start of this year.

I had 66k visitors in December 24, down to 40k in the last 30 days. This has affected my OF earnings significantly.

Other creators I have worked with and other OF creators on Reddit creator advice subs are also complaining about the decline in views, upvotes etc.

"Reddit changed their way of engagement.Now is not anymore “if you get upvotes the first minutes you get big engament for the next 24 hours”. There is a rate on your account if you are ‘spammer” in their eyes you will have no engament, i realised there are different levels as well."

"Thats why I said “”spammer” in their eyes” because for me many things are not but since this score thing is different. Do you repeat content? Do you post any links? Do you post more than once every hour? Do you have genuine interactions on the group you posting by upvoting commenting? Do you respond to your comments? If any if these questions is a no for an answer so yes in their eyes you are at certain level"


I found this interesting but not sure how much truth there is to it.
