2025-04-18 11:38:19,220 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Hi,

I got a few questions about automation scripts for uploading stuff online/creating posts - while not knowing how to code myself. I'm currently at a crossroad, because I need automation scripts - but I cannot pay someone to write them for me, as that would be just giving away ideas and creating competition. As I would need to give step by step instructions on how to do it.

On another hand, I won't spend 6 months to 1 year of my life to learn how to write 1-2 scripts and be done with it. Too much time spent for very little use of those skills.
Social media posting/bots are easily available, but if we're talking about websites that are very unkown/not popular - and a script that would include posting/uploading in i.e 30 of those websites, where every website has a different system of how posting/uploading works - it would require a custom script tailored to every single website patched into one script that does it in bulk one by one.

This goes even further where I would need a more complex automation, where I would need the script to download something, run it through desktop programs, and then do schedule uploads. Basically re-uploading + posting.

I tried using chatGPT for at least scheduling upload/posts, but since it has to be tailored to a website, it is having a really hard time to spit anything useful- or I don't know how to guide it, idk. So far I managed to install python, VS code studio and requests/schedule PIP, and that was it lol.

Is learning how to write automation script easier than I think in terms of time spent for learning? Regarding my 6-12 months of learning time, let's say 10-15 hours a week.

I know this is a very newbie post, but if anyone has any tips what I could do about it, which way to go, or what options do I have, I would be very grateful. My most prefered option would still be to pay someone to do it, but well, I trust no one, in terms of whether someone will use my future ideas, so can't think of any way of doing this right.
