Topic: Hey guys,
So say you run a blackhat business that drives its sales from a local market in your area and you know pretty much that it is never going to thrive with international/global SEO. How do you go about the GMB for that blackhat business if you really want to hide your ass yet run it successfully?
not illegal, it is just blackhat that you are paranoid and would rather just stay anonymous. Remember those faceless Youtubers?
Opinions opinions guys what do you think?
OR what's your experience in dealing with this kind of local SEO?
