2025-04-10 11:21:41,929 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Recently I came across a screaming problem. I make all my fingerprint spoof in DESKTOP correctly, impeccably.

Therefore, when you verify the TCP fingerprint two proxies used, or even 75% of the time we see them as ANDROID. I have tested various services and mostly also offer residential proxies, including TCP and Android.

Does anyone know any REALLY residential proxy? that delivers or TCP fingerprint correctly?

I understand that the residential proxy should deliver a RESIDENTIAL TCP FINGERPRINT.
