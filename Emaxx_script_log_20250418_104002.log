2025-04-18 10:42:02,426 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Here my review about Cloaking House (https://cloaking.house),

It's really bad. The Cloaking House API is dysfunctional, I get randomly "Try again later" error and the Cloaking House support is kinda useless as well. They are just telling me I am the problem, lmao.



And the worst part is, the error comes and goes. So, you won't even notice and you wonder why you don't get any sales.

Cloaking House did work in the beginning but now it's basically preventing me from making money because my users see this "Try again later". I asked if they could fix their API to no avail.

So, guys, if you go for cloaking, don't choose Cloaking.House even if its cheap. It will cost you real money by losing sales.
