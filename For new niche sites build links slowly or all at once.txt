So, there is no risk of getting a penalty from a search engine.

First, build foundational links (Web 2.0, Forum profiles, Social Media, Niche relevant Directory submission), then buy some HQ niche relevant guest posts.

A slow and steady approach helps establish credibility and reduces the risk of penalties from search engines like Google.

For long term, focus on creating link-worthy content and acquiring high-quality, niche relevant backlinks over time to support sustainable growth and improve your site's authority.

Here's a suggested 6-month link-building timeline:

Month 1: Establish Foundational Links
Set up social media profiles and niche relevant directory listings to create initial backlinks.
Month 2: Begin Outreach
Reach out to other websites and bloggers in your niche to request backlinks.
Participate in community discussions and forums to build relationships and earn links.
Month 3: Guest Posting
Reach out for guest posting on reputable websites related to your niche to gain high-quality backlinks. OR buy 1-2 HQ niche relevant links.
Month 4: Content Marketing
Publish high-quality, shareable content on your site to attract natural backlinks.
Promote your content through social media and outreach to increase visibility.
Month 5: Diversify Link Sources
Explore additional link-building strategies such as broken link building and resource page outreach.
Continue engaging with your community and building relationships for link opportunities.
Month 6: Review and Adjust
Analyze your backlink profile and assess the effectiveness of your strategies.
Adjust your approach based on performance data and continue building high-quality links.

Gradually is better. A natural backlink profile grows over timeâ€”sudden spikes can look suspicious to Google and trigger manual reviews or algorithmic filters.

Topic: Hi, it does not matter, the main thing is not to chop 100 links a month, if the site is new.


Build up gradually, if you do 5-10-15 links - then really will not be penalized, but the result - 0


I once on a new site added 30 links for 300 bucks and got a domain rating of 30, traffic and backs.

And built up 10 sites a month - the result came after a year.

Topic: Start slow and focus on quality over quantity. A sudden spike in backlinks can make your site look suspicious to Google. Keep it natural, build links from relevant sources, and give your site time to grow.

Who told you that?


Do you have any real evidence that google will ban for 30 links at once?

besides, if you start with quality donors, what to do in six months, when quality donors will run out:?

Topic: If you are planning to use a mixed backlink strategy (like Web 2.0s, profile links, etc.), you can go with bulk since they usually take much time to get indexed, so no worries there. But if you are focusing on higher quality backlinks as guest posts or niche edits, it's better to go with drip feed strategy to keep things looking natural.

If we're talking about a highly competitive niche, like gambling, cryptocurrencies, etc., then a gradual build-up won't work. I added 5 sites at a time and was able to get into the top 10 for india only after a year, this is the wrong strategy.


Yes, a few few hundred links at once but 30-40 why not.
