2025-04-18 09:31:01,944 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: I started my IPTV business in February 2023 at the recommendation of a friend. First of all, I will release two years of sales. It is $679,873 USD from February 26, 2023 to January 31, 2025. It averages $28,328 USD per month. Now I earns 50K-60K per month.



No business can work as soon as it starts. Persistence, hard work, failure and experience produce results.

I'm not trying to brag about myself, but I'm trying to mention the important points I need while proceeding with IPTV service.

1. First of all, it is important to find an IPTV supplier that provides reseller panels.

Find a company that offers the best quality while being affordable. That way, you can leave customer satisfaction and a big margin.

2. Marketing

There are a lot of marketing methods. So I don't mention about them but will show you the targets of the marketing. I targeted the American old people because most senior citizens enjoy TV shows and sports at home.

This is a few statistic graphs from my email campaign





Americans don't want to pay more for cable TV. Use big events, such as the Super Bowl or MLB, that Americans love for your marketing.

3. Customer Support

This is also a very, very important factor. Most of my customers have experienced using other IPTV services. They said me they had never received any customer support from them or they were terrible.

Satisfied clients with the customer support are continued income source as well as bring many customers to your service. When loyal customers gather, the service grows on its own without further advertising.
Many IPTV business owners seem to miss out on this. If you don't pay attention to customer support while investing time and money in advertising alone, the customers won't renew from next month.

4. Automations

You don't need this in the beginning when you have a few sales. However, if you have more customers and a lot of sales, you need to do automation for all processes. The money will automatically pile up while you're lying in bed or staying at a party.

Since I'm a programmer, I was able to implement automation myself.

5. Payment

The payment problem is the biggest challenge for IPTV business. I've had over 10 PayPal accounts suspended and multiple cash apps suspended in 2 years. Now I'm making between $50,000 and $60,000 a month, but I still haven't fixed the payment issue. If anyone knows a good solution to this problem, please share it.

I recently got scammed trying to get an additional cash app account. https://www.blackhatworld.com/seo/i-just-got-scammed-by-a-user-so-many-scammers-here.1688037/

Don't buy PayPal or Cash App on the black market. Most of the time you can't use it to get real money, even if it's not a scam.

6. Please share your own know-how or tips
