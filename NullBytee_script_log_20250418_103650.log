I'm running Ads Power on a Windows PC, but using a mobile proxy that's supposed to be on a phone, so should I choose Android/iOS?

But if I choose Android/iOS, pixelscan.net detects there is something wrong with my fingerprint, Im guessing because its on a Windows PC.

TLDR: how do I set up Ads Power profile to use a mobile proxy?
