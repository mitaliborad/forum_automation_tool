Topic: I have bought a theme (wordpress theme) and I can't change its core functions (though I have paid the price, and I mentioned the seller is selling translation of another person's theme!), because the functions.php and RTL_License_055acec9157a00cb.php files are encoded! please someone decode them for me. thanks
