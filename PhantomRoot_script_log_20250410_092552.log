So basically, my account has around 50k followers - but most of them are fake (bought them a while ago, kinda regretting it now). I’ve started taking content creation seriously and I’m posting 3 reels a day consistently, trying to go viral organically.


My question is:
Does having that many fake followers actually hurt my chances of going viral on platforms like Instagram or TikTok?
And if yes, does that mean I basically have no shot with this account anymore? Or is there still hope if I just stay consistent and keep putting out good content?
