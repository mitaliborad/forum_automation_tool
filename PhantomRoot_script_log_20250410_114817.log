2025-04-10 11:51:35,990 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Hi,

I recently purchased Telegram profiles from a global provider.
The connection process involved them providing me with a phone number, and when I logged in, they shared the verification code with me.

I’m looking for a reliable way to save the profile data, like the tdata, so I can reconnect to the account in case it gets logged out.
I’ve tried saving the tdata folder downloaded to my computer when logging in through the portable version of Telegram. However, it only works for the initial login session and doesn’t allow me to reconnect later.

I’d appreciate suggestions or methods to solve this issue.
