2025-04-18 11:06:40,406 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: I rarely write reviews, but my experience with AdsPect was so disappointing that I feel obligated to share it and warn others.


I purchased the professional version of AdsPect based on their bold claims about how advanced and effective their cloaking service is. Unfortunately, it turned out to be the worst experience I've ever had with any cloaking provider.


Despite having all my campaigns running properly, I received zero traffic. After investigating, I discovered that all my traffic was being blocked by AdsPect’s own cloaking filters. When I reached out to support, I was shocked by their response — they told me there’s nothing they can do, and their system didn’t even allow me to reduce the filtering aggressiveness or whitelist specific sources.


To make matters worse, I had only used the service for less than 24 hours, and they refused to offer any kind of refund or account rollback, even though the service clearly failed to deliver on its promises.


If you're looking for a cloaking solution that gives you real control and flexibility, I strongly urge you to stay away from AdsPect. It’s overpriced, underperforming, and the support is completely unhelpful.


Don’t waste your money like I did. You deserve a service that actually works and respects its users.
