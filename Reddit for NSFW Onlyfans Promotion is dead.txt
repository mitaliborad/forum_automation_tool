Topic: I've noticed a big decline in my Onlyfans daily visitors since the start of this year.

I had 66k visitors in December 24, down to 40k in the last 30 days. This has affected my OF earnings significantly.

Other creators I have worked with and other OF creators on Reddit creator advice subs are also complaining about the decline in views, upvotes etc.

"Reddit changed their way of engagement.Now is not anymore “if you get upvotes the first minutes you get big engament for the next 24 hours”. There is a rate on your account if you are ‘spammer” in their eyes you will have no engament, i realised there are different levels as well."

"Thats why I said “”spammer” in their eyes” because for me many things are not but since this score thing is different. Do you repeat content? Do you post any links? Do you post more than once every hour? Do you have genuine interactions on the group you posting by upvoting commenting? Do you respond to your comments? If any if these questions is a no for an answer so yes in their eyes you are at certain level"


I found this interesting but not sure how much truth there is to it.

Topic: My personal opinion that NSFW will be removed sooner or later from Reddit.

Possible reason - Reddit banned a lot of normal user accounts with its new stupid filters and NSFW traffic dropped due to that. You can see subs with millions of subscribers with only 40 online. A lot of large subs are dead. Not only in NSFW niche.

Also Reddit banned and still banning new models accounts, this leads to less posts and fresh content in general. Less content - less users on the site.

This is my subjective opinion.

They are also mass deleting NSFW subreddits and I agree with your opinion Reddit is slowly moving away from the NSFW until one day they completely do. Which is a bummer.

Topic: Huh, interesting take on the Reddit algorithm. Maybe diversify platforms a bit? See if you can pull some traffic from TikTok or X.
