2025-04-14 12:55:11,993 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: It is all from my personal experience (not stripe) and i am not endorsing any service or anything

I have read many posts looking for ways to have wise account or to buy one so here's an easy guide on how to make it I have made few personally so it works

Requirements for a UK LLC:
Address: You can get a virtual address from many online services.
UK Phone Number: Use VYKE to get a UK number for $6 for 3 months.
Step 1: Form a UK LLC Company
Register through Companies House: The registration cost has increased from £12 to £50.
Requirements:
Address: Get a virtual address with mail forwarding services. I used IconOffices. Avoid UKPostOffice.
UK Phone Number: Use VYKE to get a UK number for $6 for 3 months.
The process is straightforward. If you get stuck, search for YouTube videos for guidance. I recommend opening an LLC under the category "retail not in store..." as it simplifies opening a Stripe account.

Approval:
After submitting the application, you will receive company approval via email in 2 days.
Within 10-40 days, you will receive your UTR code at your registered address. IconOffice will provide you with a scanned copy.
Step 2: Create a Dummy Website
This is not necessary for Wise but is needed for Stripe.

Step 3: Create a Wise Business Account
Setup: Once your company is set up, go to Wise and create a business account using your UK company details. Pay the fees.
Debit Card: Request a debit card or use Wise’s virtual card.
Now you have a UK Wise business account, which you can use everywhere.

Step 4: Sign Up on Stripe
Use your company details and Wise account to sign up on Stripe.
Website: You must have a website to get approved by Stripe.
so thats all. P.s i used AI to make my english gramatically correct so its easily readable, my grammar is whack.
