2025-04-14 12:12:06,388 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Hi everyone, I’d appreciate your help.
I’ve been working as a freelance designer since 2010 without ever registering officially in Spain. My income was low and irregular, so I never became self-employed. Paying 350€/month regardless of earnings felt impossible, especially with a disability that limits how much I can work.

Now I want to open an Etsy shop to sell my digital designs. That would mean declaring taxes and becoming self-employed. I’m ready to “go legal” because I believe in this idea.

But I worry: will becoming autónomo now trigger an investigation? I’ve received payments into my personal accounts (bank, PayPal, Wise) over the years, and never filed a tax return. Can Hacienda look into past income?

Right now I earn from several sources:
Design work (inconsistent, mostly under 800€/month)
Music royalties (under $500/mo although the 2 years I was sick with Covid I could not work and music royalties where much higher)
Amazon KDP royalties (~$80/month, sometimes higher)
I have had a couple of times a big income like $1000 from kdp or a client that paid me a whole year in one go $2000
I see two options:
Become autónomo (self-employed) in Spain
Register a small business abroad (like in the US) and combine earnings with my partner under a small audiovisual company
But either way, I’m scared that declaring income now could raise red flags. Like why am I/we already earning money as a new self-employed or small business. Has anyone gone through this? Any advice?
