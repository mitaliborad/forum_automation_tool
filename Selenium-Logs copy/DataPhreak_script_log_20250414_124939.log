2025-04-14 12:53:52,809 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Hi everyone!

I'm working on a video project and would like to add a photo frame effect over my video, as shown in the attached example.



The goal is to create the impression that the video is "framed" by visual elements to bypass TikTok's algorithm. I've done some research online, but I haven't found a method to achieve this. Does anyone have advice or tutorials on how to do this?

Here’s what I have in mind:

- A fixed frame surrounding the video.
- The video should fit inside the frame and be tilted by 3%.
- Ideally, I’d like to be able to customize the frame with different photos.

I’m using DaVinci Resolve, but Canva seems more suitable for this type of manipulation. However, I’m open to other tools if necessary. Thanks in advance for your help! If you have any examples or useful links, I’d love to see them!
