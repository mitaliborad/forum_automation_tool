2025-04-14 13:36:30,734 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Using your wordprocessor (I use libre-office, it's free and powerful), with ChatGPT 40 or above, you can start publishing and selling PDF ebooks/reports. Create the book-cover here:

https://www.myecovermaker.com/

Make sure the packaging is professional and looks good. You can add a video series to the ebook/report (step-by-step video tutorials/video guide), that they can download and a password-protected website your customers can access, allowing them to download more resources related to the topic of the ebook/report. More, you make sure that when they purchase the ebook/report from you, their name, transaction # and email is stamped at the footer of every page. That will go far in preventing people from freely giving away your copyrighted content/ebooks/reports. If they give it away for free, you will know who it is, and if they sell the ebook/report, their customers will want access to the website that is connected to the ebook/report and the videos. So they'll still have to contact you and pay you for access. Maybe you can give them a break if they tell you who they purchased it from, what website..etc. You have the stamp but to further verify who is illegally distributing your copyrighted asset/ebook/report.

You can use Calibre (it's free), to format your ebooks/reports:

https://calibre-ebook.com/

Strip Kindle of their DRM locks here:

That's the holy grail for making money online. Selling PDF ebooks/reports and whoever tells you it's impossible to do that today, doesn't know what they're talking about. You can visit the Gumroad market here:

https://lifemathmoney.gumroad.com/l/TwitterGuide?layout=discover&recommended_by=search&_gl=1*13zdwmo*_ga*MjYxNTkwNDY4LjE3MzY3MjEwOTk.*_ga_6LJN6D94N6*MTczNjcyMTA5OS4xLjAuMTczNjcyMTA5OS4wLjAuMA..

If he can sell an ebook for $200, you can sell 10, or 30 PDF ebooks or reports daily between $3.00 and $12.95. Set up a sales funnel, where you give away a free sample "lite" version of your ebook or report (or a full ebook report that only presents theory, without praxis/the instructions on how to execute it), without access to the most valuable information and resources that will allow them to actually do it, whatever it is you're showing them. For that, they need to purchase VOLUME 2 - PRAXIS, step by step instructions with full access to the video tutorials and the resource library (password protected website). How do you market this product? Social media, through paid ads on Tik Tok, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube..etc. Paid ads. You drive traffic to your offer and a % will buy it. Once you have the digital product completely and ready for market, you focus on marketing it. You can hire others to do the marketing for you, once you start making money. Wax on, wax off, rinse and repeat.

Make sure to add affiliate links in all of your ebooks/reports, that way you can make a commission whenever someone purchases a product or service using your link. You're also driving them to the password protected website/resource library/resource center, where you will also have affiliate links and ads, for other products, including your own products. This customer should already be subscribed to your email list, where you will every once in a while give them free ebooks/reports full of your affiliate links and also offer them your other products. You provide 80% free, valuable stuff to your email list subscribers and then you make them a paid offer (20% of what you're sending them). 80/20.
