2025-04-14 13:06:01,304 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Hello everyone! I've been taking part in contests on the 99designs platform, and while I do win some, I mostly end up losing due to the high number of designers involved in each contest. It often feels like a waste of time. Although I can't deny that this platform has helped me become a stronger competitor, I believe there must be better ways to utilize my time.

I've been considering the concept of passive income as an alternative investment of my time. I have a knack for creating Ui/Ux designs for web and apps. Do you have any advice on how to get started with passive income? Additionally, I'm curious about the effectiveness of using Ui kits for generating sales. Any insights or recommendations on this matter would be greatly appreciated.
