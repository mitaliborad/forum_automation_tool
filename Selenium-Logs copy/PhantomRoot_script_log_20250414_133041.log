2025-04-14 13:33:54,321 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Hi everyone,

I’m facing a frustrating issue and would really appreciate your advice.

My website apkflex.com has been live for over 3 months now. All content is original (no copy-paste), and I’ve done a decent job optimizing on-page SEO. But after the recent Google core update, only 10 pages are indexed — and that number hasn’t improved.

I’ve already tried:

Manually submitting URLs via Search Console
Regularly pinging URLs
Updating internal linking structure & sitemap
Even purchased indexing services (including those that use API and ping tools)
=> But nothing worked, and I’m still stuck at just 10 indexed pages.
What’s interesting is that I do get consistent traffic from YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook, so the content is getting real user attention. It's not spammy or AI-generated junk.

So I have a few questions:

Could this be a case of my site being sandboxed by Google?
Are there any reliable ways to boost indexing in 2025 that actually work?
Has anyone experienced a similar situation and successfully fixed it?
Any tips, tools, or insights would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!
