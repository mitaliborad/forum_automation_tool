2025-04-14 14:14:51,521 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Hey, I moderate a few very big subreddits, focused on NSFW pictures/videos of celebs.
We currently direct the traffic to our new Telegram group, which is growing very fast.

We now want to make a premium/vip group, to share onlyfans content.
The idea is to sell access to the vip group to all members of the main Telegram group and monatize it that way.

We are looking for anonymous payment methods (at least on our end), which are also easily accessible for everyone.
Direct crypto tranfer would be perfect but I dont think many people have this opportunity. Crypto vouchers, Paysafecards or Amazon giftcards are great at first glance, but cant be cashed out anonymously.

I guess in the best case scenario we would just have crypto in the end, no matter on which way but without giving out our data.
We live in Germany and would like to evade any taxes.

Do you guys have any ideas? Thanks a lot
