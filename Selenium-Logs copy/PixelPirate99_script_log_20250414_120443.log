2025-04-14 12:07:56,729 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: I have two YouTube videos that are currently ranked on the second page of Google. I want to improve their rankings so they appear on the first page. When I search for my videos on Google video search, they appear in position number 3, but when I search generally on Google, they are on page 2, position 12.

I would like to know how I can improve my ranking for a specific keyword. Any help or strategies would be appreciated. The first position is held by another YouTube video, which I believe I can compete with. If you know of any good services, I would be interested as well.

Thank you!
