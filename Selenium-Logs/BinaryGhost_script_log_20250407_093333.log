Few things which many people might not know but we know to keep our accounts safe ,so lets all share things which can help others

I will start by Contributing .

1. Posting in Meme / Pets usual karma farming subs -some specific subs can lead to ban ,reddit keeps an eye on high karma farming subs so do your own tests and make a list of subs to avoid (posting in new account or dormant account)
