I have bought ~50 domains on GoDaddy in the last few years and honestly love it. I don't understand where all the hate is coming from and wonder if there is something I should know that makes it so terrible.

I get almost all of my .com domains for 3 years for $44. Have I been overpaying all this time? Should I transfer them all somewhere else?
