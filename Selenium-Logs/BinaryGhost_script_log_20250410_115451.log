Asking the people that are used to stripe or have some experience with it

Since stripe is only geo restricted, for the people that are buying them what challenges do you face with it?

Do they always monitor your payments from the first purchases or how is it done?

Where do you usually buy stripe, is there a section in BHW for that?

any idea if these accounts last?
