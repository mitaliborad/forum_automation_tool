I am quite familiar with JavaScript and I need to learn new programming language for making bots.
Bots for communicators (ICQ, Skype, Trillian and many other). Somebody whop type to me this bot should answer everyone.
And the bots for Facebook (private messages), Pinterest (make follows) and other.

Is C++ a good choice for making these kind of bots?
