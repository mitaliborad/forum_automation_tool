I thought picking a reliable storage solution would be enough – turns out, there are so many issues to deal with: speed, ad management, stability, and even SEO for content.
For those who have set up video sites before, what part did you find the most "headache-inducing"? Any real-life tips to avoid going through the trial-and-error process?
I’d love to hear some insights from you all. Thanks a lot!
