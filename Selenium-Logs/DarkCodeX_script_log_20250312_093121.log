2025-03-12 09:33:15,820 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: I've been using different review platforms, and I recently came across NichanRating. It seems to offer more features than Trustpilot, like proof of payment verification, live ratings, and a reward system for reviewers.

Trustpilot has been around for a long time, but there are always complaints about fake reviews and companies manipulating ratings.

Has anyone here tried NichanRating? How does it compare to Trustpilot in terms of reliability and fairness?
