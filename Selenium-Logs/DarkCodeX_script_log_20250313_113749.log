2025-03-13 11:40:52,210 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Hi everyone,

So long story short, I happen to have a decent amount of mobile shared proxies from a DIY farm I'm hosting at home, we're talking great speeds (20+ mbps) and the ability to rotate these as I busted my ass in figuring out API commands, other than reselling these, what are some valid use cases that could have some financial return?

A big problem though is that these aren't US proxies or even europe, these are in the middle east ))

Meaning we're looking for use cases that are mostly about the proxies themselves and their performance, not the location, any ideas other than reselling? I highly doubt people would be looking into buying middle eastern proxies (I'm open to the idea if people are)

Thanks in advance!
