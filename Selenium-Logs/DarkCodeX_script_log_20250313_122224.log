This thread was created to resolve the problem of adding a warning banner about fake reviews on sites such as TrustPilot, Sitejabber and others. Who solved this problem and how?

Also I think it could be easy to gift such a banner for competitors, what do ya think? It will be interesting to hear real cases or competent opinion.
