2025-04-02 13:58:10,159 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Hello everyone,

I am in Germany and bought from Amazon Lyca Mobile US SIM for creating US TikTok accounts. When I activate SIM I indicated an American address (NewYork zip code). But I didn't use US IP (VPN, Proxy). After register SIM is not catching Germany network (Telekom, Vodafone). Please give me advise how to use US SIM in Germany or may be you have another working method to creating US TikTok accounts outside the US.

Thank you all.
