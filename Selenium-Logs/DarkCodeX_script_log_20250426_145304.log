And even then... oh well. If you fall for the attention grab that's on you.

Anyway. What do you do? You go where the big guys go -> right now that is GlobeNewswire.com (went from mere 500k to 1.9m in traffic over 2 months) and it ranks well, really well. For actualy competitive queries.

Only PRs accepted (AP Style) - but that's easy enough. If you got a bit of money laying around, want to test an affiliate offer, this is the one to go to right now.

Examples: "Online Casino"



"NSFW AI"



"best testosterone booster"




Deccanherald still works too, especially for loan or crypto terms.

Let's see how long this one lasts.
