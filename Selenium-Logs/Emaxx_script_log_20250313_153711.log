2025-03-13 15:38:55,128 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: What I'm NOT looking for is anything on YouTube SEO.

Long story short, one of my clients is thinking of getting rid of their YT channel as it's too costly to maintain in its current form (with a dedicated presenter & in-house editing team)

I'm trying to convince their CMO that we, the SEO team, could make use of the editing team to create more content and help our SEO strategies.

Every bone in my body says that a good YT channel is fantastic for branding (which is good for SEO) and that videos embedded in my SEO content are going to help the organic performance of said content, but I can't find any studies, data or examples to back it up.

I'd also appreciate any examples of brands that are using traditional organic Google search and YouTube side by side to help build a brand.

Thanks in advance.
