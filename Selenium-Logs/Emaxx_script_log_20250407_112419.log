2025-04-07 11:27:26,382 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: I mean sites with thousand of almost identical pages/subdomains like plumber [city] where only the city changes.

Besides siloing, webpage speed and interlinking what are good ranking/backlink strategies for sites like this?

For me the crawling budget and lack of good domains is a limiting factor.

Would love to hear insights from those doing the same thing.
