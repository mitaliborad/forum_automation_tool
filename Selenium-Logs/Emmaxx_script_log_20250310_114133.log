I recently made a surprising discovery—most of my Pinterest pins are not indexed on Google! Curious? You can check yours too!

How to Check:
Simply search on Google using this format:

site:https://in.pinterest.com/pin/(your-pin-id)

If your pin appears in the search results, congratulations! You can drive traffic to it directly from Google.

This pin is for the example -




I checked one of my old pins (2 years old), and guess what? It’s still not indexed!






Your turn!
Now it’s up to you—find a way to get your pins indexed and unlock more traffic!

Have insights or tips? Share them below!

Thank you!
