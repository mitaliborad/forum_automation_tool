2025-03-12 10:47:18,583 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Most tokens get listed without a solid project, which leads to the failure of the token, hence the dump without revival.

For a while now, I've been looking for ways to analyze new token launches and identify centralization risks and eventually saw a platform that specializes in analyzing token distribution and wallet connections through interactive bubble visualizations, making it easier to understand token ownership patterns and identify potential risks.

Their official token, $BMT, which has secured significant backing funds of €6.5M since 2023 till date from a mix of blockchain protocols, will be listed soon on Bitget.

What do you think about the project cause for me I feel we need things like this in the crypto space.
