2025-04-01 10:32:35,357 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: I started on OnlyFans about a year ago. Initially, everything went fine, but as I got deeper into AI content creation, I felt that the platform was limiting me. I switched to Fanvue for a while, and while it was better for content freedom, I still had to deal with submitting personal IDs and copyright documents every time I posted something AI-generated.

Here’s how they compare:

OnlyFans has the largest user base and the highest willingness to pay. However, we all know that KYC is a hassle, creator accounts are expensive, and the content policies are the strictest here.
Fanvue claims to be the most AI-friendly platform, but even it is tightening its policies and still requires ID verification. Especially when I don’t trust the privacy protection of any platform, I’m worried about when my face and ID photos might be leaked. It’s dangerous, and I don’t want anyone to know that I’m doing this. But now, I’ve found a better solution.
