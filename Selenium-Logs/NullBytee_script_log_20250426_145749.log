2025-04-26 15:00:56,511 - DEBUG - Attempting to locate main post element with locator: ('xpath', '//div[@data-lb-id and contains(@data-lb-id, "post-")]')
2025-04-26 15:00:56,582 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: So here’s how I set up the account. First, I grabbed a static residential proxy from Ping Proxies and added it to my anti-detect browser, which is Dolphin Anty. After that, I logged in from the browser to make sure the proxy was good. I checked it on Scamalytics and IPQualityScore to verify the fraud score, and everything looked solid.

Then I hopped over to my personal browser and went to onlineonlinesim.io to rent a US phone number so I could create a Gmail account. I used the rented US number to verify the Gmail and everything set up fine. So with that all done, I thought everything should be good, right?

After setting up the Gmail, I added a recovery phone number from a different US number and set a recovery email that was also created through a proxy and is tied to another US email. Again, I figured, all good?

Then I made a new Reddit account. Logged in, used my new US Google account to verify my Reddit account so I could get that "Verified Email" badge under achievements.

Followed the usual warm-up process too.
First day: just scrolled.
Second day: scrolled again.
Third day: started browsing subs I like, upvoted 2-3 posts.
Fourth day: upvoted another 2-3 posts.
Fifth day: started joining subs I actually like, kept scrolling, upvoting, even saving and following posts.
Seventh day: made my first comment, got around 3 upvotes.
Eighth day: dropped 4 comments, started getting 5 upvotes on comments. So it looked like the account was warming up fine.
Then on the 10th day, my account got banned. Gmail flagged as coming from a bot and it’s now set up for deletion. No idea how to move forward with this. Could it be:
Static residential proxies are flagged by Reddit or Google? Should I switch to rotating residential proxies instead?
Maybe my anti-detect browser or proxy setup isn’t right? But I do buy the proxies, add them to the anti-detect browser, check the connection, and check the fraud score too.
Did I create the Gmail too fast? But if it didn’t get flagged for 10 days, why would it get flagged after? Is there a way to prevent Gmail from flagging later on?
Is renting a number from sites like onlineonlinesim.io sketchy? Should I be using an actual real number instead? Or if there are alternatives, maybe you could recommend that as well?
Really not sure what to do next. I spent a good chunk of money setting up the proxies, making sure each account sticks to just one proxy, one US Gmail (made on anti-detect browser + proxy), and so on.

Kinda getting worried about my other accounts too because they were created the exact same way. They’re still alive for now, but if they all get suspended too, that’s basically hundreds of dollars down the drain.
