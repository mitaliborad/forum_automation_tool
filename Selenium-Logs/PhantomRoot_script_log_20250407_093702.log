2025-04-07 09:42:19,469 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Hey Guys!
I wanted to share what I did step by step to get a Google Knowledge Panel in around 1 Month.
It was easier than I expected tbh but let's begin.

1. I had a Domain that already had a DA 20-60 (ahref 20 - MOZ 60). On this website i placed the Schema MetaData for my Name, Social Profiles, and anything relevant to the Knowledge Panel.
2. I created a Wikidata account. I edited some Posts (Filled in some Statistics or whatever) to get the "AutoApprove" Handle on there.
3. Then I created a Wikidata Page about myself also linking to the Social Media accounts and the Website
4. I went on expired domains and bought a domain that already was linked to another Knowledge Panel (Sort by Wikipedia Backlinks so you can find them easily) and linked from that Page to mine.

I talked to a guy who also tried this but because he did not have the AutoApprove Status on WikiData he lost his Wikidata Page and his Panel as well.

But the Panel that I got on Google did not Display anything (Socials / Pictures) it just said my Name.
I have a very Unique Name (Artist Name) so there is no competition on that Panel. If i were to type out my Full Name i do not think the Panel would show up.

So what I did to get Pictures in there is this:
- I had an Article about myself on a Trusted News Station and "Requested an edit" for the Panel.
I linked to the Article and the Picture they posted with it and they approved. They did not approve previous attempts of pictures from my website or Instagram etc.
Because the Article also linked to my Website there was proof for me to send to the Knowledge Panel Team to get my Domain and my Socials in there.

I did not yet get a description because most of them are from Wikipedia Articles or IMDB or something. But i heard that some of them are also from Facebook. I just have to try to send it in 100 times to get it approved.

So what I would recommend when you want to edit the Panel:
Get as much "Proof" as you can from Articles to Websites to Social Accounts and even Wikidata etc. They are 100% more likely to change something

Maybe I was just lucky but it worked for me really fast. At the Start, it disappeared sometimes but after filling out more and more info it stayed.

Let me know if you ever tried to get a Panel and what you struggled with or what you did differently
