2025-04-16 09:34:16,303 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: I hate twitter ads. You hate twitter ads. Figured out something about the ads.

They might be a bot, but I can guarantee you can promote in the paid ads and get far more visibility. Don't worry if it doesn't show up in the engagement - all the comments/retweets in the comment section go to the person paying for the ads but you will get just as much visibility as they litter ads throughout the regular tweets.

Now keep in mind once you post 5-7 comments in the ads the Ads will disappear for 2-4 days. Twitter algo will automatically make ALL ADS unavailable for you and they will vanish. Have a dummy account and just cut, copy, paste the url.

Hope this helps you guys go around the crap algo & hop on the paid ads without spending a dime.
