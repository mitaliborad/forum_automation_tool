2025-04-09 09:55:29,166 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: More and more AI video generators are getting regulated. Yeah, I'm talking about generatorss like Kling and Hailuo. They used to be really flexible. You know, there was this unrestricted freedom where you could do all sorts of things without getting restricted. But what about now? Look at what they've become. Not only is the generation speed unacceptable, but the content filtering also seems to be getting stricter and stricter. Is there any AI video generator that can turn pictures into videos without restrictions? Can anyone recommend one?
