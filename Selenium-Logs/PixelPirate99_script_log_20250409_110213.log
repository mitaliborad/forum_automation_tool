2025-04-09 11:05:18,354 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: hello! i made a reddit account generator that can generate 300 accounts per hour, the problem is, the accounts can sometimes be unusable, below are my observations

i first used bulk IPORT proxies i bought from oxylabs and proxyscrape, sadly, seems like im not the only one using the proxies and going to reddit.com it shows "You’ve been blocked by network security" for about 60% of the proxies, however, if i keep generating accounts, im able to generate 50, i also recorded the IP addresses they were generated in, i made a script that logs in the accounts via the same proxies they were generated and upvote a post, only a few are able to upvote, BUT they are able to upvote

now, because some IP addresses are blocked i switched to a residential proxy from oxylabs, the problem is, even if i use session parameters, a proxy is only available for one day until it is replaced, so, the accounts are logged in via a random ip, im not sure if that is the problem, but if i attempt to upvote a post from any of the accounts i generated, it NEVER updates, i refresh the page and the upvotes return to the original count

is there any way i can bypass this? currently im looking into using the bulk iport proxies again instead of a rotating one, but the problem is, they are detected and sometimes blocked by reddit
