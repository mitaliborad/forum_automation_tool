2025-04-16 09:34:47,841 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Hey guys, I’m researching some information on how to achieve this and have some questions that I haven’t been able to find answers to on the internet so far. Here is the process I’ve come up with:
- 4G Mobile Proxy (HQ)
- iPhone with ShadowRocket
- Factory Reset
- US Sim Card (unactivated)
- Sign up with newly created iCloud email/Google Email
- 1 device per acc

If I understand this correctly:

1. Insert the SIM card into the phone.
2. Set up the phone to use US settings.
3. Download TikTok, proxies, and an anti-detect browser.
4. Create the account this way.

My questions:
• Should I use the US SIM card’s mobile data, or is it fine to use my Wi-Fi? (Sorry if this is a stupid question.)
• Should I create and upload content to TikTok via the app or through the anti-detect browser? (or normal browser if proxy is ON)
• If the account gets banned for some reason, can I create a new one on the same device right away? Or should I reset the phone and go through the process again (e.g., change proxy, etc.)?

This is what comes to my mind. Thanks for any tips!
