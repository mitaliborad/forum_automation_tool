2025-04-26 14:44:44,212 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Hi There,

I am here because I noticed that some of the new EMD domains have a ranking on SERP within two months. I have a few EMD domains but I was unable to rank those keywords.

My domain keywords search volume and competition is low whereas competitors keywords search volume and competition is high. I have implemented on page very well build EAT links or high authority links for my website, still I am not able to rank my EMD domain.

So my question is what strategy they are using to get rank within a two months.

Please guide me
