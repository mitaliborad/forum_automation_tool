I've tried using setups like GoLogin or ADSPower combined with Smartproxy or Oxylabs, but none of them worked—my reviews still ended up being removed.
For the proxy part, I purchased residential proxies.

If anyone is willing to share their method with me, I’d be happy to pay for it. Just leave your contact details and let me know how you managed to do it.
