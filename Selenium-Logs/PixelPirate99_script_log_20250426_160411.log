2025-04-26 16:06:54,814 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Hello

I’m hoping someone here can provide some insight or direction. Last week, my Google My Business profile was suddenly suspended without any clear reason. I’ve hired a freelance company to help with GMB management, but I personally review and approve all content before anything is posted.

We’re a legitimate, service based business, fully registered as an LLC with the state. The business name on the profile is our actual legal name, with no keyword stuffing or violations that I can identify. There haven’t been any changes to the listing recently (no updates to hours, address, or other info), and all the posts simply highlight our services and provide helpful industry tips.

When I received the initial suspension notice, it mentioned that one of the profiles didn't follow the guidelines. In response, I immediately removed the external manager from the account and submitted an appeal.

Unfortunately, the appeal was denied. The latest message states:
“Content that violates our policies on deceptive content and behavior isn't allowed. Deceptive content intentionally misleads or deceives others.”
However, I’ve gone through everything and can’t find anything that fits that description.

If anyone has dealt with a similar situation or knows someone reputable who can assist, I’d be extremely grateful for your help or recommendations.

Thanks in advance!
