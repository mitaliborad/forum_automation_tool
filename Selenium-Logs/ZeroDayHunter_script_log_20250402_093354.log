2025-04-02 09:38:29,702 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Hello Guys,

I need some tips on how to "securely" register a Domain, so that in best case its anonymous.
The Thing is I want to keep my Data private.
I've read about njalla, but it seems that they should be avoided for several reasons.

Would you recommend just registering a Domain with fake Whois information?
Which Domain Registrar can you recommend ?
Basically i am looking for something which doesnt care about DMCA Requests.

Also Registrar should not be located in the EU Area .
Any recommendations are welcome
