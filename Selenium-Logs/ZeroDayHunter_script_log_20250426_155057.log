THE CODE is written in "go lang", and it use Rod library.The problem
I was new to web scraping and I was trying to create a scraper which scarpe data and otput json file.

But the site kept rejecting my connection because it thought that I was a bot, so I used UserAgent to create a fake useragent string to try and bypass the filter.

It 's not worked. But the problem was that the first time i run the scraper to the website by a browser, it work , but when i tried after it doesn't anymore

Mabye I have to lok more humna ?antiMashDelay: 500 // ms. Or i should use undetected-chromedriver?
