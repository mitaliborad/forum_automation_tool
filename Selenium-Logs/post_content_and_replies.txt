Instagram Account Creation - What's your thoughts?

Topic User: 0x1malloc
Topic: I've been working on some instagram project lately... just testing algorithms and so on.
For me to test, I signed up using protonmail email with my rooted phone.
I have intercepted all the traffic, had a browse through which logs are sent and so on.
I notice they use play integrity like most apps nowadays, my device passes that.
However, upon registration my account was suspended instantly.
I haven't been using my IP to create tons of accounts; this is my first time. However, I do have another Instagram account thats years old. That's my only IP tie to Instagram.

I'm trying to figure out why exactly they suspended it instantly. I suppose the APK I tested with had a patched SSL bypass, which may be marked by Instagram by now.
I will bypass their SSL pinning pretty easily anyway, despite which version. I used the patched version just to test.

I also attempted to sign up via browser, and was hit with the following error:
"Sorry, something went wrong while creating your account. Please try again soon." which to me screams they have marked my IP, or temporarily limited it.

So my thoughts right now:
The patched SSL pinning APK is maybe marked/patched by Instagram now, and they auto ban accounts that are registered from it.
They don't like ProtonMail
They don't like forwarded mails.
They don't like devices that don't meet play integrity (MEETS_STRONG_INTEGRITY)

If anyone wants to share their thoughts or experience, please do.

Are you usong custom OS? That's cancer, no matter what I've tried, they figured that out so not worth it. Proton as well might be a dead end try with gmail and otjer toer 1 emails. I am using rooted phones too, with own twist, haven't been using SSL pin lately, but I am using latest apk version since somehow that passes on acc creation. Amd I am using phone numbers

Yes I'm on custom OS. However, I have been through all the logs, decrypted them, and I can see exactly what sort of data they store and use against people. I have made sure that the phone is almost completely undetectable. They have no idea the device is custom though. I only did test with the publically available patched SSL apk just to log the connections and check for any new signing procedures and so on. I will just use Frida to bypass the SSL pinning on the latest APK, that way it avoids signature checking and so on. Chances are that the publically available APK on github is flawed and they can detect it because of the signature checks. So that will be a dead end no doubt. It's looking like the best thing to do is use dispoable phone number services instead of emails. The problem with the better known email services is that they require phone numbers too, which is a waste of resources most times. I have already pulled their APK's apart (I've been doing this stuff 15 year now, so I'm certain of what they store on devices, and whatnot). The reason custom OS's are brutal is because of play integrity, or not properly rooted / disguised. Disgusing your device properly is a lengthy procedure, but I have already got that stuff covered. I think the publically available patched APK is what got me flagged

Topic: So my last 2 accounts:

1) Brand new phone. Brand new verizon prepaid SIM. Instant ban. Appeal put in the number they don't have record of it (brand new). Had to download whatsapp and do the form that way. Uploaded a photo not showing my face - account approved couple hours later.

2) Yesterday - tried adding second brand to my business suite (verified both as corp and personally). Facebook created fine. Instagram was instant ban. Appeal using cell phone number from above. Fine. Uploaded a photo of the back of my head. I just checked and it was approved.

I don't think a human is reviewing these. Yesterday I was talking to someone from the UK and he can create accounts fine. He thinks its a US thing. I mean they need new users for wall street reports so this can't be happening to everyone.

Topic: Humans are 100% not reviewing, it's down to their AI. After spending time reverse engineering it, I've found several things that will trip flags. I'm still working on it and running tests etc. May I ask which brand new phone/device you used out of interest? Did you use the Instagram app for it as well, or just the web version? I'm a UK person too, and yes, creating accounts from different countries has different effects on account quality. This is due to EU laws and so on because of AI. 1st tier countries such as US and UK seem to have the most issues because of AI.
