Best Methods to Avoid Detection When Posting the Same Video on Multiple IG Accounts?

Topic User: winwreck
Topic: Hey everyone,

I'm managing multiple Instagram accounts and need to post the same videos across them without getting flagged for duplicate content. I know Instagram tracks hashes, metadata, and posting patterns, so I’m looking for the best ways to randomize videos efficiently.

What specific tools or workflows do you guys recommend for automating this at scale?

Would love any insights from people who have successfully done this without bans. Thanks!

I’ve dealt with posting the same content across multiple accounts, and here’s what’s worked for me:
Change Metadata: Re-encode your videos using tools like HandBrake to change the file name, resolution, or bitrate. Instagram checks for duplicate hashes, so this helps.
Use Scheduling Tools: I use Hootsuite, it lets you schedule posts at random intervals to avoid pattern detection. Just make sure your posts don’t go live at the same time across accounts.
Add Minor Edits: A simple filter change, text overlay, or slight cropping can make your video look unique to Instagram’s system.
Rotate IPs: If you’re automating, consider using proxies to give each account a different IP. This prevents Instagram from linking your accounts together.
Lastly, avoid posting like a bot! Keep everything organic and human-like to stay under the radar.

Let me know if you’ve tried any of these or have more tips!

I'm using an anti-detect browser myself, which can create a lot of instagram accounts, and at the same time, you can warm up for RPA management of these accounts, which may make you think that you are a living person and not a robot, reduce the probability of being blocked, and also carry out some large-scale publishing operations.

To avoid getting flagged for duplicate content on IG, randomize videos by tweaking metadata, resizing, or adding filters. Use tools like Jarvee, Nextpost or Fanzella for automation, and make sure to use high-quality proxies. Gradually increase posting frequency to avoid sudden spikes.

Yeah, modifying the title, resolution, and trimming the video can help, but IG's algorithm also detects reused content through visual and audio recognition.
