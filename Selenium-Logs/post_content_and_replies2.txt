Facebook Groups

Topic User: Mus4shi
Topic: Hello,

I'm looking for an automation tool that can do the following:

I have around 30 Facebook accounts using 4G proxies, and I want them to post in my Facebook group at set intervals. The content should be fetched from specific Facebook pages or groups that I provide. The tool should scan these sources, extract their content, and then post it to my group.

The problem is that I haven't been able to find a program that meets these requirements, except for SuSocial, which was laggy. Additionally, since I have 30 accounts and use 4G proxies, SuSocial's pricing is too high for my budget.

I’ve looked into Maxcare, FPlus, and MKT Group, but none of them seem to offer the option to fetch and monitor content from pages. I’m also aware of FoxMaster but would like to find more alternatives.

If anyone can recommend a better tool, I’d really appreciate it.

Thanks!

Topic: * Finding an automation tool that fits your specific needs can be quite difficult, but here are some alternatives you can consider:
Zapier lets you automate tasks between different apps. You can set up “Zaps” to pull content from sources and post it to Facebook.
Integromat (Make): Similar to Zapier, Integromat allows you to create more complex automation workflows with many options and integrations.
Hootsuite allows you to manage and schedule posts to multiple social media accounts at once.
SocialBee: Social media content management tools that help you schedule posts. You can use RSS feed integration to pull content from specific sources.
* If you have programming knowledge or can hire a developer, you can build a custom solution to automate this process. Using Facebook's API can help you automatically fetch and post content.

You might want to check out NextPost, or AutoPostBot. Some custom Python scripts with Facebook’s Graph API could also automate this, but you’d need some coding knowledge. Have you considered using Zapier or Integromat to fetch content and post automatically?

Topic: You need a tool to automate 30 Facebook accounts (4G proxy), scrape content from other pages/groups and post to your group. SuSocial is too slow and expensive, and Maxcare, FPlus, MKT Group do not have this feature. You can try FoxMaster, Jarvee or develop your own solution using Python + Facebook API for better control. If anyone knows a better tool, please share!

Topic: You can tailor your specific requirements, especially the ability to pull content from external sources and post it to your Facebook group. You can look for professional software developers to create a custom tool that meets your exact requirements. This may be more expensive, but will ensure you have a perfect solution. There are a number of open source Facebook automation tools that you can customize to suit your needs. However, this requires some programming knowledge. Before you start looking for a tool, clearly define your specific requirements, including the features you need, your budget, and your skill level.
