Choosing and testing an offer

What is the first thing that catches your eye when choosing an offer? Of course, the payout is critically important, but it's just the tip of the iceberg. To "make a profit", you need to dig deeper.

Advertiser status and GEO relevance. Assess how much potential the offer has in your region.
Retention. Without user retention, scaling is impossible.
Communication. Quick feedback from the advertiser and transparency in statistics are important.
Test. Minimum 30–40 FTD to have an objective sample.
KPI. Give preference to products with soft KPIs and a realistic payback period.

Break down complex offers into points. Check whether the product is new, whether it is easy to register (verification should not "kill" conversion), and how convenient the platform itself is. Game quality, UX, interface, adaptation to GEO - everything matters.

Red flags: inflated KPIs, too short a payback period, high baseline, difficult registration, high wager.
Traffic trends: algorithms, AI optimization and autorules

The market situation is changing, and advertising networks are increasingly relying on AI. Algorithms are becoming smarter - approaches to the bay must evolve.

What's new in algorithms?
Auto-navigation is priority #1. Algorithms need time and data. If traffic immediately shows bad metrics - it is unlikely that anything will improve over time.

Creatives and landing pages - must have.
Algorithms analyze behavioral factors. If the user does not interact - the campaign is instantly merged. It is important to keep attention at each stage of the funnel.

How to work with AI optimization effectively?

Give the algorithm 3–7 days to train.

High-quality input data = better optimization: segmented audiences, lookalike, trained pixel, clear creatives.

Avoid sudden changes immediately after launch.

Autorules - why and how?
Automatic rules save budget and time.
Example:

$8 - no clicks → off

$16 - no installs → off

$30 - no registrations → off

Working without automation in 2025 is like running barefoot on broken glass.
Cloaking is the basis of stability in 2025

Without high-quality cloaking, arbitrage will not survive. Moderation algorithms are becoming more and more aggressive, so the approach must be as accurate as possible.

️ Why cloaking?
To show a “white” page to moderators/bots, and a real “black” page to live traffic. Otherwise, block one by one.

What works now?

Combination of filters: IP, User-Agent, Referer.

Combined methods (redirect, iframe, local options).

A high-quality “white” page — without questionable elements, clean according to GEO policy.

When choosing a service — pay attention to filtering irrelevant audiences. For example, a language filter is a must-have if you want to get to the right user.

It is important for us not only to bypass moderation, but also to protect links from competitors.

Minimize bans

Regularly update IP databases and bot behavior patterns.
Do not pour a large volume at once — the ramp-up should be gradual.
Optimize and test links constantly.
Automation in arbitration = speed up!

The winner is the one who automates routine and analyzes faster.

Spy services — follow competitors, trending offers, take the best creatives and approaches.
AI tools — ChatGPT, Copilot — create parsers, scripts, campaign autoruns.
Dashboards — set up ROI, CPA, LTV metrics to make decisions based on numbers, not by eye.
Text generation — Copy.ai, Jasper — write texts adapted to the desired GEO.
AI audience analytics — Perplexity, Bard analyze FB Ads, Google Trends and user queries — perfect insight by region.
Optimization and scaling — how to fill in effectively?

Do not rush to cut ties — even with a high CPL, sometimes it is worth giving Facebook an additional budget. But don’t expect a miracle — if it’s “empty,” it’s off.
Creatives = the key to scaling. Working creative? Just replace a few elements and run again.
Segmentation — analyze the audience by age and gender. For example, if men 45–54 give the lowest CPL — create a separate campaign.

But be careful. Too narrow optimization can increase CPM. If you run only on Instagram, but FB is enabled in placements — don’t turn it off, it can worsen the situation.
