Topic: Synthesia,

CapCut and Canva have AI integration aspects in them now as well. But if anyone has any better resources I would love to use them! There are a lot of good AI videos and full music videos out now that people are making and I would love to know how they are making these!

Topic: For AI video creation, you might want to check out tools like *Pictory* (great for turning long-form content into short videos), *Synthesia* (AI-generated avatars for professional-looking videos), and *Descript* (offers both video editing and transcription with AI features). These apps can save a lot of time and effort while delivering high-quality results.
