Boosting YouTube Video Rankings: Strategies to Move from Page 2 to Page 1 on Google ?

Total comments in the thread: 9

Topic User: masssinissa
Topic: I have two YouTube videos that are currently ranked on the second page of Google. I want to improve their rankings so they appear on the first page. When I search for my videos on Google video search, they appear in position number 3, but when I search generally on Google, they are on page 2, position 12.

I would like to know how I can improve my ranking for a specific keyword. Any help or strategies would be appreciated. The first position is held by another YouTube video, which I believe I can compete with. If you know of any good services, I would be interested as well.

Thank you!

Topic: Your best bet would be to build some decent links,
I'm assuming your video is spam free and won't cause any critical UX problems like high bounce backs, or low dwell times,
So, basically, nothing much to do in terms of on-page, adding a paragraph for description could be helpful as well, but the rest will be about links

you can't add schema to a backlink, that's not how it works,
if you meant embedding the video to some webpages, then yes, that could be as good as pointing links

You should build a mix of links pointing to the YouTube video URL along with embedding it in several high authority pages/websites,
I won't refer to anyone selling links, but it depends on the ROI being made here,

If you expect to make some sustainable & good earnings from the video, you can invest in building your own PBN (or renting homepage PBN links),
Or reach out (or pay someone to do so) to authority niche relevant websites to add guest posts with links/embeds pointing to the video,
Both could work if done right, but be cautious because the majority of the sellers are selling trash, useless links that won't make any difference,

Other than that, specifically for YouTube videos, parasite-type websites could be easier to allow you to embed the video rather than linking to it,
Any well-known, authoritative, and preferably niche-relevant website that allows users to add content and embed YT videos could be a good addition

Topic: Try updating the description and title to better match the keyword, add timestamps with hints, and definitely link your video from other platforms (like a blog or subreddits). Also â€” play around with the tag list, sometimes that gives an unexpected boost.
