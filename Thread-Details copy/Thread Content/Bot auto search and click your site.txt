Topic: Hi everyone,
I plan to make a bot that automatically creates a profile (with its own parameters, its own proxy like gologin, multi login,...)
then searches for keywords and clicks on my website.
Is this effective for SEO?
Has anyone tried it?

Topic: they open sourced the google search code for a couple of minutes and there was a whole bunch of data they were tracking for every search. (hovering and time hovering over links was one of them).

It probably won't be a success, but definitely worth a shot

I see people doing it on microjob websites. it seems to be making them money because it's natural, but I don't think google is this dumb.

You can use tools and scripts to automate that. Iâ€™ve seen that both Gologin and Hidemium can do it, but Gologin tends to be more expensive
I have built a tool to do this with Gologin, Also build tool to register new gmail automatic, but it not works

Topic: Using robots that automatically create accounts, search for keywords, and click on your website is ineffective and even harmful to SEO. Search engines will detect this unnatural traffic and may cause rankings to drop or even be de-indexed. In the long run, this behavior cannot improve the quality of the website, but may lead to penalties.

Have you contacted technical support yet? Previously, I used Gologin but faced many issues, so recently I switched to Hidemium. I find it runs smoothly, is affordable, and the technical support is very responsive.
Can you register mails bulk automatic with Hidemium?

Topic: A strong factor,
If the bot can reflect some cookies[social media/E-commerce platform or some other good reputed forum or website] before landing or after being on your website.
It seems more natural to google
