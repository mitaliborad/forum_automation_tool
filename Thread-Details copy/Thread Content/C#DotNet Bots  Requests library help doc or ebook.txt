Topic: If you are just starting I wouldn't bother thinking about capcha etc.. although important to get something production ready you are no where near that stage. I personally like to use puppeteer now having uses selenium previously. There is a feature in Chrome which allows you to record you actions and then export it as script.. saves some time starting out. From their there are some anti detect libraries. Once you've mastered that start thinking about capcha, finger prints, profiles etc .

Topic: Alright, so for web scraping in C#, check out HtmlAgilityPack – pretty straightforward to use. As for reCAPTCHA, that's a whole different beast; you might need to look into anti-captcha services. An API is basically a way for your bot to talk to other services or websites without you having to manually mess with the code every time.

Topic: Please don't make another bot! you can find so many on github for free, and they are pointless they just get you information & data then you'll be posting how I make money with scraped data a few months down the line. (You can't!! everyone and their granny knows how to scrape that can use python)

Go build something worthwhile in a niche you are in. I'm in the animation niche, and I'm building myself the best software possible I can animate with the way I want. I think other people will purchase it, but I'm not so concerned with that right now that I am in getting it working for my own youtube productivity. I'm building the whole thing in electron which 2 weeks ago I didn't know anything about.

10 days later I have the UI about 80% complete. (and about 1% backend code lol )

I would rather build something that is usable by me and others to make money on platforms, rather than just scrape data for exploitation (generally against the t&c of the platform). There is a big difference.

I have no clue when it comes to programming, lol but I know how to get things done and work my ass off, and learn.

I started off programming crappy bots, and on reflection, I wish I had just built better software to fill gaps in the market. Bots don't fill the gap in the market because the market contains thousands of foreign workers with low rates on freelancer sites that can all build them cheaply.
The best WP themes I have ever used are with Themify. They have a great range and are all secure, updated, and affordable

Web Scraping in C# – Best Libraries

To create a web scraping bot in C#, you can use:
• HtmlAgilityPack – Parses and extracts data from HTML.
• Selenium WebDriver – Automates browsers (best for JavaScript-heavy sites).
• HttpClient – Sends HTTP requests to fetch raw HTML data.
• PuppeteerSharp – C# wrapper for Puppeteer (headless Chrome automation).

2. Bypassing CAPTCHA & CSRF Tokens
CAPTCHA Bypass:
• Use CAPTCHA-solving services like 2Captcha, Anti-Captcha, CapMonster.
• Train a machine learning model for simple image CAPTCHAs (not easy).
• Avoid scraping sites with reCAPTCHA v3, as they track user behavior.
CSRF Token Bypass:
• Extract CSRF tokens from hidden form fields.
• Include the token in your HTTP requests.
• Use Selenium to simulate a real user session.
