Topic: Facebook ads can only help to get short-term traffic. They don't directly help for Search engine ranking, but will improve your brand visibility. You need to do proper SEO to improve the Search engine ranking.

Topic: It can help indirectly if the traffic engages well — shares, comments, or links the content elsewhere. But on its own, paid traffic won’t move rankings. Google cares more about what happens after the click than where it came from.

Topic: According to Google Leak data, traffic is a ranking factor, so it could help to move your site up in SERP. There are plenty of details, like consistency over a set period of time. For example getting constant traffic over 2-3 month could work, but one day spike is nothing

Topic: Boosting blog posts via Facebook ads can influence SEO rankings indirectly, but its primary benefit is driving temporary traffic and engagement rather than directly impacting Google’s algorithm.

Topic: Boosting blog posts with Facebook ads won’t directly improve your SEO rankings, but it can help in a roundabout way. If your content gets shared, linked, or brings repeat visitors, that can send positive signals to search engines over time. Think of it more as a visibility booster than an SEO hack.

Topic: Ads are great for quick traffic, but if your content’s solid and keeps people interested, it can lead to long-term wins too.
