Topic: I have this question, maybe somebody here can help..
I run a pharmacy/research-chemicals service.

So far I have registered domain *.eu on Njal.la but I heard that they are starting to block such domains.

Where is the best place to move to?
I mean a domain registrar that does not have a problem with pharmacy.
Flokinet.is dont allow any pharmacy stuff, easydns their TOS requires pharmacies to have a license,
