Topic: For those running ads at scale, how are you managing IP rotation these days?
Are you sticking with residential, datacenter, or going mobile?
Which setup is working best for you right now to avoid bans and keep accounts alive?

I think it is better to use static IP instead of rotating. You can buy IP addresses by measuring the risk status of the IP address via IPqualityscore. I recommend using different IP addresses for each different account. You can also use anti-detect browsers for this. I do it this way and I have had very few problems.
