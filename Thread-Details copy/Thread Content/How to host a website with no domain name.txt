Topic: You can host a website without a domain by using your server’s public IP address, like http://178.248.238.94. Just set up a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx, or Node.js) on a VPS or server with a static IP, place your website files in the root directory, and ensure port 80 is open. While it works fine for development or internal use, you won’t be able to use HTTPS unless you have a domain or a special IP-based SSL certificate.

there are plenty of video/blog guides out there, just do a quick google search or any AI tool for guideness,
this should be for testing only, you can't rely on using an IP address for branding/SEO,
a domain name is just a tiny investment to be made for this

Topic: You can use a free domain service, but setting an IP address directly is more suitable for file-sharing services and makes it harder for users to remember your site.

Topic: All websites are like this only. Every website is hosted on an IP. The domain name is just to make it easy for humans.

Once you singup for a VPS you get the hosting space. if you don't attach the domain you can view the website using the static IP that was assigned to your hosting.
