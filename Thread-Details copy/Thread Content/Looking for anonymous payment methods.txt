Looking for anonymous payment methods

Total comments in the thread: 9

Topic: Hey, I moderate a few very big subreddits, focused on NSFW pictures/videos of celebs.
We currently direct the traffic to our new Telegram group, which is growing very fast.

We now want to make a premium/vip group, to share onlyfans content.
The idea is to sell access to the vip group to all members of the main Telegram group and monatize it that way.

We are looking for anonymous payment methods (at least on our end), which are also easily accessible for everyone.
Direct crypto tranfer would be perfect but I dont think many people have this opportunity. Crypto vouchers, Paysafecards or Amazon giftcards are great at first glance, but cant be cashed out anonymously.

I guess in the best case scenario we would just have crypto in the end, no matter on which way but without giving out our data.
We live in Germany and would like to evade any taxes.

Do you guys have any ideas? Thanks a lot

Topic: you know .... you still have to pay taxes for crypto right ?
and you have to declare exactly where this funds come from and have a solid track record of all transaction ids etc
if you can't prove the source of funds they can confiscate, give you a big fine or some jail time
just saying

I know quite a few adult merchants using OB now.

I thought that maybe I could buy some crypto, transfer this and the earned crypto to a crypto casino and then cash out the earnings to a crypto exchange. For them it would look like casino winnings XD But I think you are right, that is probably a bad idea â€¦

Topic: Is there maybe something like a vouchers/coupons system that I can also cash out? I mean no government institution can proof from where those vouchers came from, right?

You'd have to reach out to an Open Banking PSP such as Klyme or Volt. They should be able to accommodate for high risk sectors such as adult.

As there are no payment schemes (Visa, Mastercard) involved within Open Banking payments, it's a lot more feasible for merchant to obtain the service.
