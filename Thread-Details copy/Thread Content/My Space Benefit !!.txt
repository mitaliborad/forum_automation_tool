With their non playing playlists, and no loading images for most celebrities. I would love to know a way too. I think best stick to band camp and SoundCloud.
The best WP themes I have ever used are with Themify. They have a great range and are all secure, updated, and affordable

Topic: Honestly, for marketing in 2024? Maybe nostalgia bait if your audience is old enough, but you're probably better off focusing on platforms people actually use daily. What are you hoping to achieve?

Myspace is a social network that was born in the 2000s. In the past, it was very famous and had a large number of users. Myspace helps connect users, helps famous people become more known and quickly become famous, helps business investors reach users quickly,... You can use them for business. However, nowadays, there are some more developed social networks so Myspace seems to be just a name.

Topic: If you love music, nostalgia, or want a quirky, low-risk platform for creative experimentation, Myspace has a lot to offer. It's not a gold mine -- more like a quirky side hustle or passion project space. Platforms like YouTube or Bandcamp are better in terms of real growth or profits, but the charm of Myspace is its simplicity and small, loyal community.

If you sell products to seniors, you will benefit. Because young people do not know about Myspace. Older people still use it to keep memories
