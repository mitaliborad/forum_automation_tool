Need help with passing recaptchaV3

Topic: I know it might be a stupid question. I see a thousand ways how v3 could be passed, but I have no luck with it.
I am trying to automate it.
Should I use Playwright or Puppeteer with stealth.
My score is always low with any proxy I am using. I’m stuck and depressed right now.

There are several proxy providers, is it for automation? You can use it, I use yescaptcha and it works well with API key I can show you how it works if you want.

Topic: Try using Playwright or Puppeteer with stealth, but ensure your proxies are high-quality, undetected, and rotate frequently to avoid detection and improve your score.

Topic: Hey Guys, thanks for all your responses.

Yes it is an automation we are using selenoid with puppeteer and proxy from nodemaven . If I use this proxy without solenoid it has high 0.7-0.9 score on https://antcpt.com/score_detector/ but with solenoid and stealth I have low score. I haven't tried tampermonkey didn't know about it.

As an example of recaptchav3 + cloudflare there is https://www.northcarolinaresidentdatabase.com/opt-out
I am using 2captcha for tokens, but it does not accept it and write me that I am robot almost 90% of cases

I know that I'm doing smth wrong because there are a lot of articles that tells how simple is it to pass this v3 captcha
