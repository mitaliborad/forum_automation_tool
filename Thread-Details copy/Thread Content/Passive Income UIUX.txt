Passive Income UI/UX

Topic: Hello everyone! I've been taking part in contests on the 99designs platform, and while I do win some, I mostly end up losing due to the high number of designers involved in each contest. It often feels like a waste of time. Although I can't deny that this platform has helped me become a stronger competitor, I believe there must be better ways to utilize my time.

I've been considering the concept of passive income as an alternative investment of my time. I have a knack for creating Ui/Ux designs for web and apps. Do you have any advice on how to get started with passive income? Additionally, I'm curious about the effectiveness of using Ui kits for generating sales. Any insights or recommendations on this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Topic: Contests are useless and waste of time, you spend your whole day making a great design just so the client choose a lousy one made from a random template. That's frustrating.

Better start selling your own service, you can start from here, get a JrVIP membership and post a BST thread.

Topic: Create 5-10 versatile templates (think avatars, presentations, themes, or UI/UX layouts for websites) and tweak them based on buyer requests. This way, you maximize your time and earnings with minimal effort.

Topic: Bro, I think it's better to learn some HTML and CSS or Frontend, and convert your designs to those tecnologies, I think you can get some income than designing, because I was a designer and I didn't get any job until I learn something about Frontend. Well... it's my advice if you want to earn something as a designer.
