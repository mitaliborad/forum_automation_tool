Topic: Yeah, man, it's possible. But not all reviews can be deleted. First, you need to check if any review violates Google's policy. If so, there is a chance.

I provide such a service, it's not cheap. Payment is made after completion of the work. I have cases and satisfied clients.

Topic: Google will remove reported reviews, only if Google finds such reviews as violating Google's policies. So, even if a service provider promises to remove any and every Google review that you need removed, then think twice.

You are absolutely right! Anyone who promises 100% removal is lying.
