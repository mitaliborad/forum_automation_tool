Topic: Using your wordprocessor (I use libre-office, it's free and powerful), with ChatGPT 40 or above, you can start publishing and selling PDF ebooks/reports. Create the book-cover here:

https://www.myecovermaker.com/

Make sure the packaging is professional and looks good. You can add a video series to the ebook/report (step-by-step video tutorials/video guide), that they can download and a password-protected website your customers can access, allowing them to download more resources related to the topic of the ebook/report. More, you make sure that when they purchase the ebook/report from you, their name, transaction # and email is stamped at the footer of every page. That will go far in preventing people from freely giving away your copyrighted content/ebooks/reports. If they give it away for free, you will know who it is, and if they sell the ebook/report, their customers will want access to the website that is connected to the ebook/report and the videos. So they'll still have to contact you and pay you for access. Maybe you can give them a break if they tell you who they purchased it from, what website..etc. You have the stamp but to further verify who is illegally distributing your copyrighted asset/ebook/report.

You can use Calibre (it's free), to format your ebooks/reports:

Strip Kindle of their DRM locks here:

That's the holy grail for making money online. Selling PDF ebooks/reports and whoever tells you it's impossible to do that today, doesn't know what they're talking about. You can visit the Gumroad market here:

https://lifemathmoney.gumroad.com/l/TwitterGuide?layout=discover&recommended_by=search&_gl=1*13zdwmo*_ga*MjYxNTkwNDY4LjE3MzY3MjEwOTk.*_ga_6LJN6D94N6*MTczNjcyMTA5OS4xLjAuMTczNjcyMTA5OS4wLjAuMA..

If he can sell an ebook for $200, you can sell 10, or 30 PDF ebooks or reports daily between $3.00 and $12.95. Set up a sales funnel, where you give away a free sample "lite" version of your ebook or report (or a full ebook report that only presents theory, without praxis/the instructions on how to execute it), without access to the most valuable information and resources that will allow them to actually do it, whatever it is you're showing them. For that, they need to purchase VOLUME 2 - PRAXIS, step by step instructions with full access to the video tutorials and the resource library (password protected website). How do you market this product? Social media, through paid ads on Tik Tok, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube..etc. Paid ads. You drive traffic to your offer and a % will buy it. Once you have the digital product completely and ready for market, you focus on marketing it. You can hire others to do the marketing for you, once you start making money. Wax on, wax off, rinse and repeat.

Make sure to add affiliate links in all of your ebooks/reports, that way you can make a commission whenever someone purchases a product or service using your link. You're also driving them to the password protected website/resource library/resource center, where you will also have affiliate links and ads, for other products, including your own products. This customer should already be subscribed to your email list, where you will every once in a while give them free ebooks/reports full of your affiliate links and also offer them your other products. You provide 80% free, valuable stuff to your email list subscribers and then you make them a paid offer (20% of what you're sending them). 80/20.

I'm glad you found that post useful. Gumroad and other services like it, allow you to sell your digital products for a % of the price. They're going to take like a $1.00, a small fee. Not much. The benefit of selling your digital products through Gumroad and Ejunkie, is that they provide a way for your customers to pay you, you can also have affiliates marketing your ebook or other digital products (you pay them a commission when they sell one of your products - the gumroad will take care of paying out commissions). There are also many people who browse through the gumroad market, and they will find your digital product/PDF report. When you have an ad running in social media (Facebook, Youtube, Instagram, TikTok), you can drive the traffic (the people who respond to your ad/s), to your gumroad product page, where they will either purchase the product or subscribe to your email list. I believe they can subscribe to your email list in gumroad or ejunkie, but I'm not sure, I have to check. I am going to write a full report on how to make money with PDF reports and information products in general, like video courses..etc. I'm going to give detailed instructions on how to do it in that report, which will include some videos and password access to a resource hub. I'll keep you posted.

I looked at his gumroad. He's not selling ebooks for $200 lol these are basic ebooks. Are you really saying just steal content from kindle and strip it of its DRM lol

Wouldn't it be easier to just write ebooks about your expert subjects? Why you have to steal others' content, your imagination isn't good enough?

Pitfalls might be not choosing the right topic or subject to write about, and not providing enough information on the subject. You have to provide a step-by-step process; that's what people want. For you to help them, from beginning to end, step by step. A process, a system. If you provide that level of instruction with resources, like what I mentioned in the first post, providing them with a password protected website, that contains more information and resources, maybe even a way to communicate with other people who are taking the course, to ask questions..etc (a forum), that will add value to your PDF report. You're also building your email list, which is very important. You know how they say that "the money is in the list" and that's true. If you have an email list with 10K or 100K subscribers, you have a captive audience or market to promote your products. Like I said, provide your subscribers with valuable free information, maybe free reports and ebooks, and then every once in a while you promote one of your products. You build trust, confidence, and provide them with value, and then you send them a promotion, and you'll make more sales that way.

I never said anything about plagerizing or "stealing" anyone else's content. The other ebooks, serve as research sources, references. You can also draw information from websites, and your role is to organize the information, put it all together. ChatGPT, can you help you research and organize the content, re-writing some of it and then you can edit, add information, in your own words..etc. It's a combination of all of the above, but I'm not suggesting that anyone copy and paste other people's copyrighted content and pass it off as their own. That's plagiarism and illegal, hence I'm not telling people to do that. If that's what you think I'm doing, you're misinterpreting what I am saying. Today we have many tools, to write valuable content, which we can use to make the process, the work much faster and easier. You'll have more time to enjoy your life, reducing your labor, the time that you're working. I'm going to add information in my next report on how to author reports using ChatGPT and other AIs.

I'd like to add, that the book on making money on Twitter, that I presented a link to, is indeed selling for $200. If you read my post, I don't suggest anyone sell their PDF report or ebook, for $200, but there are PDF ebooks, that do sell for that price, and the people who are selling those ebooks are making money. The price point that I sell my ebooks for is between $3.00 and $12.95. I stay within that range.

I make money from the initial sale, but sometimes three or four times that in a year or so, from affiliate commissions and selling other reports and products to my email list, comprised mostly of former customers/buyers. The password-protected website serves as a means to increase the value of your report, but also to sell other products you're affiliated with, and to decrease the likelihood that your ebook will be given away for free or resold by someone else.

When you sell the report or ebook, the customer's email and transaction # is printed on the footer of every page. Your customer also gets an ID, connected to the transaction of the report/ebook, allowing them to open a password-protected account. Done correctly, it becomes practically impossible for someone to profit or benefit from giving away your copyrighted ebook for free or selling it without your permission, because their customer will want access to the resources on the website, and they won't be able to access it, without their ID, that is connected to the product you're selling and own the copyright to.

PDF ebooks/reports with "extras" (PW protected website full of resources, videos..etc), not just increases the value of your digital product but effectively, in most cases, ensures others won't try to sell or give away your digital product, without your permission.

Topic: Solid blueprint for building a passive income stream with digital products. The idea of stamping each PDF with buyer info is clever for tracking and discouraging piracy. The upsell strategy with Volume 2 and gated video content adds serious value.

Quick question: How do you automate the buyer info (name/email/transaction ID) stamping into the PDF after purchase? Any tools you recommend?

You can do that. I prefer coding my own websites and apps, plugins, from scratch but I'm a control freak. If you're normal (unlike myself), you can do it with WordPress, you just have to find the right plugins. You can also have ChatGPT code the plugin for you. If you're going to have ChatGPT code it for you, you're likely going to need ChatGPT Pro, which costs $200 monthly. So it's an investment, maybe a bit too much for people who are just starting out and don't have much money, but if you can afford the $200, I would do it.

Believe me, if you do it right, you can make money selling information products, in PDF format. I prefer selling information on PDF than Kindle, although I can also offer Kindle with the PDF. You don't have to sell on Amazon to sell Kindle, although you can also do that. Amazon assumes you won't sell your ebook outside of their platform, especially in PDF. I like PDF, and I notice that my readership loves PDF.

Selling ebooks or reports is still a viable, effective way to make money online, even in 2025. You have to add the other extras, like videos, the PW protected website/resource center..etc. You add the other elements to the PDF, increasing its value.

You can sell it anywhere online. Social media, both paid and free advertising, on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest, X/twitter, in PPC/Pay Per Click...etc. You can use SEO, natural, organic traffic, paid traffic..etc. You can use even print ads, classified ads..etc. Many ways to market it. You can give away something for free, and then advertise the paid version or "volume 2."..Think, be creative, there are many ways to promote your digital products, your PDF reports. You can even use money-drop cards like this:

or direct mail, mailing out postcards,

You can also create an affiliate program, where people promote your ebooks, and whenever they make a sale, you pay them a commission.

It looks like the admins deleted my post, where I answered that question and added links to several websites. Google "Ejunkie" or Gumroad, and they have a PDF stamper, that stamps the PDF with your customer's email and other personal information, including the transaction #. With ChatGPT Pro, you can code the infrastructure of your online digital products business or PDF ebooks/reports business. I see based upon the response I've gotten on this subject in the forum, that I should create a step by step guide on how to start and effectively run this type of business.
