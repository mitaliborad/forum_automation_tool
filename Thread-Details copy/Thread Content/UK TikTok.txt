TikTok detect whastapp links/numbers in videos and in bio. To bypass it, you need landing page where you put your whastapp

Topic: No, using a UK TikTok account to promote a betting WhatsApp group link can get your account suspended. TikTok prohibits gambling promotions, and UK laws also restrict such ads. It's risky and not recommended.

TikTok prohibits promoting betting or gambling. So I do not recommend you to create a UK account to promote. Also, you cannot attach a direct link but must use a landing page.

Topic: TikTok prohibits gambling-related promotions, including betting links, unless strict guidelines are met, such as obtaining platform approval and adhering to UK laws. Violations risk account suspension, so proceed cautiously and check TikTok's advertising policies beforehand.

Creators do direct their audience to external platforms, like WhatsApp groups through bio mostly

Topic: Promoting a betting WhatsApp group on TikTok, even with a UK account, is risky. TikTok has strict policies against promoting gambling and betting content, especially if it violates local laws. Even if your account is from the UK, you may still face account suspension or bans due to these policies. It’s essential to be cautious and ensure you’re complying with TikTok’s community guidelines and local regulations to avoid potential penalties. Consider using platforms that explicitly allow gambling content if you want to promote such services safely.

Topic: I mean, yeah I suppose you can. TikTok's strict with gaming related ads as is of course, doubly so if you link off to WhatsApp or TG. Well, I mean if you link off the platform in general, but you get it. Even without the mention of betting directly in your videos, the link in bio (or even comments) can get you flagged too. There are ways around it like someone already mentioned, use a landing page for one. Keep clear of the obvious algo triggers that get you flagged. Maybe game the system and go for commentary or memes angle (though commentary still gets flagged as a false-positive so YMMV). Lastly if you wanna stick to that, try not to get too attached to your account and maybe have a few more on standby.

Using a landing page is the safest option, but it still gets detected sometimes.

I personally outsource that sort of thing these days so I'd rather not try to get in the swing of things using someone else's project, that'd be irresponsible of me.
