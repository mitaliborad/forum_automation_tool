Topic: I think its better to start with old YT channel account with old videos in it. YT reserves a boost for those channels based on experience only.

You can use old channels even with 0 subscribers and even outside your niche. Those channels with random videos that are age years ago. It will still work

if it is a new account, then you need to wait for 2-3 weeks , even 1-2 months in some cases, if you arent getting impressions yet, make sure you still upload videos and also focus on retention rate too and if your boosting your channel, yes the likes and comments method works, however make sure you get it from a good quality smm panel.

High CTR is because low impressions. Its normal high CTW low impressions. More impression and views tou get, the lower CTR gets. Quality videos, seo optimization, frequency of upload, right topic selection.. the usual stuff.

Topic: Same here. My YouTube channel was stuck for a while. I realized my titles and thumbnails weren’t good enough, and I wasn’t posting consistently. Once I started fixing that and paid attention to what similar channels were doing, I slowly started seeing better results.

Consider experimenting with different content formats or topics, as well as refining your SEO strategy with more targeted keywords. Additionally, try promoting your videos through collaborations or engaging more actively with your audience to boost interaction. Analyzing your YouTube Analytics for insights on viewer behavior can help you tweak your approach further.
