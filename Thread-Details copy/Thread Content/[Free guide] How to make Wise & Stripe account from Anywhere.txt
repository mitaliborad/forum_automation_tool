Topic: It is all from my personal experience (not stripe) and i am not endorsing any service or anything

I have read many posts looking for ways to have wise account or to buy one so here's an easy guide on how to make it I have made few personally so it works

Requirements for a UK LLC:
Address: You can get a virtual address from many online services.
UK Phone Number: Use VYKE to get a UK number for $6 for 3 months.
Step 1: Form a UK LLC Company
Register through Companies House: The registration cost has increased from £12 to £50.
Requirements:
Address: Get a virtual address with mail forwarding services. I used IconOffices. Avoid UKPostOffice.
UK Phone Number: Use VYKE to get a UK number for $6 for 3 months.
The process is straightforward. If you get stuck, search for YouTube videos for guidance. I recommend opening an LLC under the category "retail not in store..." as it simplifies opening a Stripe account.

Approval:
After submitting the application, you will receive company approval via email in 2 days.
Within 10-40 days, you will receive your UTR code at your registered address. IconOffice will provide you with a scanned copy.
Step 2: Create a Dummy Website
This is not necessary for Wise but is needed for Stripe.

Step 3: Create a Wise Business Account
Setup: Once your company is set up, go to Wise and create a business account using your UK company details. Pay the fees.
Debit Card: Request a debit card or use Wise’s virtual card.
Now you have a UK Wise business account, which you can use everywhere.

Step 4: Sign Up on Stripe
Use your company details and Wise account to sign up on Stripe.
Website: You must have a website to get approved by Stripe.
so thats all. P.s i used AI to make my english gramatically correct so its easily readable, my grammar is whack.

Topic: I wouldn't do that. These cheap UK LTD companies need to pay taxes every year.
You should buy a UK LLP if you live abroad and you are not from the UK
So you just need to file a tax report instead of paying taxes, it's more expensive but in the long run it definitely worth it

no taxes as long as your business is generating under 80,000$

also when you are making that much other opportunities open anyway so its easier to start from UK company , fast and cheap

also idk about LLP but dont u need additional partners for that

Yes, it is possible to create a single member LLP.
There are some annoying conditions about UK LTD, make sure to read before creating one.

Topic: UK companies are 100% anti-privacy
Your name and even your address may be publicly available for everyone who check it
Besides, it is not a tax heaven, you don't have many tax benefits there
I would buy a Delaware LLC if you need this kind of company in a more reliable country

you still makes zero sense, even if assumingly you get your business acc banned why is there a need to fake the documents. the account is still being assumingly banned overall, also it doesn't get banned if all u do is legal bizniz

I mean even BHW owner uses UK company, you dont have to care much about your name as long as you are not selling something illegal

secondly Its expensive

thirdly it takes 14 weeks to get ITIN number to open bank account also cost like 300$ to file for ITIN

You don't need an ITIN to create a Delaware LLC, especially a single-member one that is disregarded for tax purposes.

You Need ITIN to create Bank account on your Company name if you are not from US,
No other way to make any Bank account without ITIN except wise which is also getting harder

You can use Mercury and other online banks (Brex, Novel, Zenus, etc). They don't require you to have an ITIN, visit the US or being american.

Mercury Brex only accept your application if you belong to a tier 1 country

try with indian, pakistani, vietnamese and majority of the asian passports and find out.
