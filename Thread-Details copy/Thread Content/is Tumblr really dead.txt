Topic: I worked earlier on it but now I do not have idea about it. People use it for personal blogging. Tumblr blogs does not rank in google. It is good for creating backlinks. Thanks

Topic: You can still use it for adult content but you need to be very careful with what exactly you are posting. One bad post could lead to your account getting banned.

Get your facts straight.

Use Pinterest instead.

Maybe if you capture mails from that site... Or use Tumblr ads. Is there something like that?

I don't have any idea on that because I was focusing on organic traffic only. However, I wouldn't risk my ad spend on Tumblr seeing that it's almost dead now with almost no engagement left on the platform

think i should just focus on other platforms like reddit then, wasting my energy on tumblr might not be worth it.

No clue about NSFW, but my recollection from "back in the day" was that Tumblr was never anything other than a back-link pyramid aggregator and forwarder.
