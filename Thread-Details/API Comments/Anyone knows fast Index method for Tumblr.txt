Topic: Tumblr has recently changed the way it displays links in posts. You will now see Tumblr displaying backlinks like this “a href=”http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z” + your URL“. While the ******** attribute is still maintained in the post, displaying the link through a redirect link has reduced the meaning of link building. Build good blacklink can help you
