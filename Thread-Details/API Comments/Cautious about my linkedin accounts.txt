Cautious about my linkedin accounts

Topic: For context, back in 2021, i was able to successfully bump my linkedin accounts via j.rvee on a virtual machine; residential proxies and all. I believe i had 10 linkedin accounts running at the same time and had their connections increase from 0 to 800 within months. But then something came up and i stepped off of IM. Now i'm trying to get back to it.

A few months ago i tried logging in to one of my linkedin accounts and i immediately got blocked. Linkedin was asking for id verification and now i am hesitant to login to the others for the risk of having all of my linkedin accounts getting blocked/banned.

Does anyone have any solution to this specific issue that i have? My intention was to be able to login to them and use them again for connections. I know that j.rvee is gone now so i intend to just add connections manually on my own. I wanted to make it right this time and not risk these accounts so i would like to ask for advises on the best practices. My device and IP is different now from what i had before. Also, as far as i remember i went into an extent to editing my browser's cookies via a browser extension whenever i login to a specific account but i forgot the practice now.

Thanks in advance to anyone who can share their expertise on this matter!

Use different IPs, separate browsers or profiles, clear cookies, and log in gradually to avoid getting flagged.

Create and submit stealth IDs. Stealth IDs work smoothly for LinkedIn. As far as how to create stealth IDs goes, you will have to do your own research. Obviously, please do not use stealth IDs for anything illegal or for scamming.
