How are you verifying Fiverr? Given that they do live video verifications.

I am doing arbitrage instead of completing them myself so i can manage 1000's of orders at once

78 fiverr accounts? Why?
so we are not completing orders ourself we are outsourcing all the work and me and my team can manage 78 accounts and we have identity verification and payment options to withdraw funds available then why not?
