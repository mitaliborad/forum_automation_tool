Topic: Check to see if the old domain - "siteoldsite.com" - is still indexed. If it's completely wiped out, the redirect will be useless. Instead, focus on rebuilding the authority of the new domain: fresh links, updated content, and making sure it's crawlable.

Topic: If the redirect is done recently, you need to be patient & it will take some time to see the results. As advised above, if the old domain is spammed & completely wiped out you won't see any impact. If needed, verify that the redirect setup is done properly. Also, publish more articles on the new domain and build quality links to it. If you’re still not seeing results, move on to a new domain with fresh articles and content.
