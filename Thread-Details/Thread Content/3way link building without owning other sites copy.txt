Topic: I keep running into the problem, when link building, that websites want to only deal with ABC link building. I only have the one site. Is there a way I can still participate in 3-way link building?

Topic: Hmm, you could get the details that website A want for their link (content subject, anchor, url etc) and buy a link on a PBN/niche edit service for those details. That would be your website B. Then give the website A owner the linking details for your site (website C). I foresee some issues arising from this approach though...

Alternatives could be to start additional websites (diversification is really needed in this industry), or frankly pursue a better link building tactic.

Yes, you can still participate in 3-way link building by acting as a middleman between two relevant sites. Ensure the links are natural and relevant to avoid penalties. You can also explore guest posts or content collaborations to build relationships for 3-way linking.

You're gonna have to ELI. So I'd contact a third site and offer to write a guest post with a link to the site I want a backlink from and (in exchange or whatever) put up a guest post on my own site to that third site, completing the loop, have i got that right?

You're right that I'm probably better off pursuing a better tactic, without starting other sites. Seems very roundabout to buy a link but if the end result is i spend money and get a backlink... same end result, regardless of where that link ends up?

What would a better tactic be?

Pretty much, or instead of doing the guest post point, just sell them a link. It also helps if you have multiple sites at all time, in different niches of course. It's like sitting at the table of link exchanges and only having one card, or having multiple cards.

Yeah the different sites isn't something i have atm. Also, expanding into multiple sites just as a way to expand the diversity of possible backlinks... aren't I just starting a baby PBN at that point or am i missing something

Pretty much, but you can always tier your sites, some sites would work as money sites, some would be restored expired domains with okay metrics, and you can always use these link exchanges to power up your main money sites and maybe even your other sites if you play your cards right
