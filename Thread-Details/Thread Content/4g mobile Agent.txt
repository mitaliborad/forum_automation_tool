4g mobile Agent

Topic User: youtube communication
Topic: 4g mobile proxy, I found a more serious problem, I used 300 different accounts, and these accounts were warmed up, and then I used the same 4g mobile proxy for each account, and then ran the thread according to 1234, every time an account watched the video, I will rotate the proxy ip, when I reach 200 views, youtube views after the video will be crazy decline, the front 200 is saved, but the next few minutes will be under, youtube seems to be able to identify the 4g mobile proxy base station or proxy ip pool
