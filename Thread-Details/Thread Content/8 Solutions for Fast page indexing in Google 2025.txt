Topic: Greetings to all webmasters, SEO-specialists, and everyone interested in the topic of page indexing for websites in 2025. Today, the issue of page indexing in Google has become especially relevant, particularly for new websites. The problem with indexing is indeed widespread. I want to share with you my methods for indexing pages. I hope you’ll enjoy it. It’s going to be an exciting journey, I assure you!

1) The method of indexing by submitting a link in the Search Console
This is of course a well-known method. It works (not always). You can submit up to 5-10 pages for re-crawling per day. This is quite limited, and this method doesn’t always guarantee successful indexing.

2) Google Indexing API
This method is quite well-known among many webmasters today. With one API key, you can submit up to 200 links per day. It's not a lot, but it's decent. For WordPress sites, you can use a ready-made plugin that integrates with the Indexing API. The plugin is called Instant Indexing for Google. Here’s the link: https://wordpress.org/plugins/fast-indexing-api/.

3) Submitting a sitemap for indexing in Search Console
This method is considered effective, but sometimes pages take a long time to get indexed. Therefore, I consider this method to be somewhat limited in its effectiveness.

4) Backlinks on social media
This method often works well, but it has its nuances: it doesn’t always work well for new websites, and you need to use it correctly. Social media links are best placed with text related to the link. Unfortunately, not all link vendors provide this service well. Personally, I use task exchange platforms for this, such as https://socpublic.com/. It’s a very well-known task exchange platform worldwide. One link will cost you around $0.01-$0.02. It's really cheap. Plus, you create tasks for users independently, and they complete them.

5) Fast indexing website services
Yes, you heard that right. Such services are indeed available in the market, and they actually work. However, they still don’t guarantee 100% indexing. Personally, I can recommend the following services: https://riseindexing.online/ (A good service with a price of only $0.015 per URL. It also offers a free trial period), https://addtoindex.com/ (This service can also be considered good. The price is low, just $0.02 per URL). These services have shown decent results in various tests. On average, they index up to 85% of pages (including new websites). How they do this is a big topic on its own, and if you're interested, I can cover it in a separate post or in the comments.

6) Backlinks from authoritative sites (Open for indexing)
This method cannot be called completely reliable because it does not guarantee that all pages of your site will be indexed. But in theory, search bots follow such links and land on your site. In theory, this should work. However, as practice shows, this method is not effective in all cases.

7) Your own PBN network
If you can afford to own a PBN network, then you can place links on the main pages. This, of course, does not guarantee successful indexing of all pages, but it can help, at least partially.

8) Redirects to pages that need to be indexed.
If you already have a site that receives traffic and is well-indexed, you can set up redirects from its pages to the pages you want to index. This method might work.

A few words in conclusion:
Keep in mind that indexing also depends on the quality and uniqueness of the content. I believe that this is where the work should begin. After that, you should use the methods I have outlined in this article. Personally, I think it's best to use multiple methods at once for the most effective results. For example: Submit the sitemap for crawling in Search Console, post links to pages on social media, and use services to speed up site indexing. That’s all for now—I hope you found this material interesting. Feel free to leave your questions in the comments, and I’ll do my best to answer them.

Topic: Hi. Nice article, bro.

Answer a couple of questions:
1) Why does indexing via sending ping no longer work?
2) There are rumors that the Indexing API is gradually becoming ineffective—is this true or just a rumor?

avoid indexing api. it will index 99% pages at first, and within 3 to 4 months, all pages will drop. Also, google will penalize your sites for using it for non-jobs/events related pages (in long run), But you can use this indexing api on throwaway domains.

Greetings. You ask interesting questions.
I don’t know why the method of sending a ping to the Google search bar has disappeared. Apparently, Google can no longer afford to spend so much resources on indexing, so they removed this method. But this is my personal opinion; I’m not claiming that this is indeed the case. Sending a ping is too simple a method, and everyone could constantly use it.
I’ve heard that the Indexing API has started to perform worse. I think this is true because it has been heavily used. But most likely, this method should still work. However, I don’t know what will happen to it in the future.

Wow, that’s some news! Is this your personal experience? Was it with just one website or with many? And why do you think Google does this?

Thank you for your answers. I understand that the method of sending pings has become outdated. But with the Indexing API, it’s still unclear to me why it works worse. And another person here mentioned that pages are dropping out of the search results. Overall, Google is tightening the screws on us more and more.

Hi. I think the most effective approach is using services to speed up indexing + backlinks on social media.

Yes, it really works. But I prefer backlinks from: Twitter, VK, and Ok.ru. I buy them on Socpublic for a very low price.

That's true. But the content also needs to be in demand and unique in meaning.

yeah, personal experience. It was with many sites. Not only me, but many on BHW forum have written about this after using indexing api for few months. You can try it yourself with demo domain if you want.
