Topic: Hi，guys

I hope to start cross-border e-commerce in China with zero capital.
I recently learned about a dropshipping service.
But I don't know how to do it. I know many people do things related to Tiktok and Facebook

Please give me some advice

Topic: Identify your product, drive buyers to your purchase page via social media, wait for them to purchase. Good luck with no investment though.

My market is Chinese exports. Choose your product carefully.
