AI to build a Website

Topic: Are there now AIs that can create websites well? I know in the beginning the AIs were very bad but now they are very good.

Does anyone know or use an AI for this? I sometimes use Grok and it always helps me very well but of course it's not specialized.

Is it a good idea to use AI code in your website or even just code from AI? What about SEO? Seo experts here who have tested this?

I would prefer free of course.

Topic: In terms of SEO, you can use AI to write content and then use another tool to check if the content is written by AI or not because Google does not like content written by AI. Then we need another tool to check for duplicate content.

Topic: Honestly, they're getting better, but I still wouldn't trust AI to build a whole site without a human double-check, especially for SEO stuff. Maybe use it for generating code snippets or brainstorming content ideas, but keep a close eye on the quality.

Topic: I tried to build a website using AI on Claude and it looks cool. But if you are not a coder/developer you wont be able to modify it. You need some skills to modify it to make it work for you. Otherwise it give you result like themplate.

Topic: You're totally right—AI for website creation has come a long way. What used to be clunky and limited is now shockingly good, especially with the newer models (like GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, and Grok). Many developers, agencies, and freelancers now integrate AI into their workflows either to build entire websites or to speed up parts of the process.

AI can do much more than that with the right prompts, and even experienced coders take lines from these codes to add to theirs. Some even use the whole script itself just to create their own website and no one would notice the difference. In my experience, you just have to create a prompt that is direct, concise and structured in a way that AI would understand. Just like giving instructions to a High Schooler or a college student.
