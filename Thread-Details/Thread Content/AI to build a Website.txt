Topic: Are there now AIs that can create websites well? I know in the beginning the AIs were very bad but now they are very good.

Does anyone know or use an AI for this? I sometimes use Grok and it always helps me very well but of course it's not specialized.

Is it a good idea to use AI code in your website or even just code from AI? What about SEO? Seo experts here who have tested this?

I would prefer free of course.

Topic: In terms of SEO, you can use AI to write content and then use another tool to check if the content is written by AI or not because Google does not like content written by AI. Then we need another tool to check for duplicate content.
