Adult Video - Hosting Solution?

Topic User: maxeem
Topic: Hello.

I own an adult tube website and since Doodstream (and other alternatives) are trash in terms of ads, earnings and performance, I got the great idea to host my own videos.
The website i run is based on WP-Script + Wordpress.

I want to buy a dedicated server where I would store my videos but I can't find a solution which allows me to embed the videos from the server to the website.
I'm looking for something similar to Doodstream, BunnyCDN or any other similar alternatives but I want to host it and decide how many ads I should use.

Can someone provide some feedback or ideas?

I'm more interested in a software / solution for embedding the videos.
I can find tons of servers but how do I embed the videos on my main website?

I want something similar but I want to host it. Bunnycdn becomes very expensive and, at some point, I pay more than I earn.

Everyone is talking about hosting, but not about your problem of embedding the videos from the server to the website. This is why third-party hosts are so helpful. How much traffic do you bring in? If it's not a lot, then don't go through the trouble of this. If you have a lot of traffic, I can give some tips...

You can refer to third party hosting platforms, I found some pretty good services that might meet your needs. But let me ask you a little bit, do you want to host videos and make money on that hosting service or do you just want to host?
