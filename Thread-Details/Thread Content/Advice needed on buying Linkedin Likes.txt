Topic: I've never seen an account closed for that reason, if that's the only factor. Some of the likes can be deleted by linkedin, but I don't think there is a chance that the account will be closed

Topic: Yeah, a lot of factors can cause that so with only the limited info we have, it's hard to say for sure if purchasing likes directly lead to the account being lost. Unless there were other offenses or underlying reasons, I'm quite safe in the assumption that something else might have caused the ban or something.
