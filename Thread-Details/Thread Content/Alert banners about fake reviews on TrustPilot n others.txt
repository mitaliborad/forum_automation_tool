Topic: Hello, BHW community!

This thread was created to resolve the problem of adding a warning banner about fake reviews on sites such as TrustPilot, Sitejabber and others. Who solved this problem and how?

Also I think it could be easy to gift such a banner for competitors, what do ya think? It will be interesting to hear real cases or competent opinion.

Topic: If you want to mess with someone's Trustpilot page and business, this is definitely one way to do it.

It has been this for years and competition does this all the time... this is what makes Trustpilot an extortion business - they know it and don't care.

There is nobody to complain to, if the competitor wants you out, you'd be happy if you didn't have Trustpilot in the first place.

I have a few customers who had that banner before they came to me and some of them did get rid of it, but not before they paid for a Trustpilot premium subscription which now costs more than $3000 as they removed the option to pay it monthly.. you need to pay for the entire year at once and this $3k is their minimum plan... fees only go up from there.

I didn't see this among the Google Reviews. However, I think that in this case it is possible to try to delete the profile, or rename it to some similar company, change all the information to another one. And create a new profile with a real company. Unless there are less radical ways, of course.

If it is a highly profitable niche, then it makes sense to pay and be calm. However, of course, they deny the impact of the paid plan on moderation and the connection between their platform and business. In this case, how do you get rid of this banner, just pay $3000 and that's it?

Perhaps it is possible to remove a page through the DMCA, but I have not applied this to TrustPilot or Sitejabber in practice.

I don't think it works via DMCA - most people first think about that when it occurs to them that they want their site to be removed.

Even if you manage to get it off from Google, the page will remain on the Trustpilot platform.

It's not that easy. They all have had to jump additional hoops and whatnot and paying them doesn't guarantee anything.

It varies from case to case and I think they also look at how long that banner has been there and have you learned your lesson and not added any reviews in x amount of time.

Usually, the Trustpilot manager tells you over the phone if that is possible or not.

I agree that it is not easy to take down reputable sites through the DMCA. But I've seen some agencies make sure their page is empty. I think there are two ways - dmca or attacks, do you have such cases?

Now I am personally interested in how to remove a banner on Sitejabber without deleting the page. Maybe you know?

When we cancelled our subscription with sitejabber complaining about their poor support, they flagged our website and closed our business account with them. Now they only let 1 star reviews go through. If anyone leaves a 5 star review, it won't be approved. This is the type of company sitejabber is. I plan to write a long detailed post about this with evidence and screenshots in the near future.

Thank you for your story. I understand that this issue has not been resolved and your site is still listed on this scam platform?

Yes. I have considered filing a chargeback on those payments to sitejabber for their premium plans for services not rendered but have held off on that to avoid further complications.

So in terms of getting your webpage removed from sitejabber completely:

1. It's possible to get Google to remove it. We have a plan for this and haven't executed on this yet. Still trying to resolve the issue with sitejabber team 1st but they have stopped responding to e-mails for weeks. We will likely submit an attorney general / bbb complaint next.

2. Data deletion. You could try this angle and submit a request for the data to be deleted.

3. Getting a court order and restraining order. I highly doubt sitejabber legal team will fight this. They will likely fight a lawsuit if money is involved which you have little grounds to sue them on anyway unless they did something in violation of their agreement. In my case, they didn't. In their agreement they can terminate an account at any point. It's unethical how they're doing business and a borderline shady business practice.

Any other suggestions you have let me know. Would really like to find a solution and if you do find one, let me know.

I doubt that communication will help resolve the situation they have created. However, I am also trying to resolve it this way, but they have not responded to me for quite some time.

Please send me in dm so that we can keep in touch with each other on this issue. We could consolidate our forces.

Okay done but I am going to wait post sitejabber communications before I escalate things further.

Hey! Any update regarding this? I have a similar issue with TrustPilot and need them to take down the profile or at least need Google to remove it. Any idea?

I haven't really started but will soon here. Need to respond back to the FTC regarding sitejabber activity as well as they aren't truly a free review consumer site, they have personal bias and not allowing businesses to actually utilize their model.

Sitejabber locked me out of my account and not a single 3 to 5 star review has been "allowed" to be published on my page in over a year. They clearly didn't like me cancelling my subscription with them and have basically blacklisted our page. I have flawless reviews on ebay, shopify, amazon and other marketplaces.
