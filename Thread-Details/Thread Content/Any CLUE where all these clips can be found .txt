Topic: I think they just downloaded them from tiktok. And it grew over time. Im doing the same and i just checked i have 200+ files already: I suggest you do the same so you’ll only download what fits on your niche. If you’ll buy that package its more likely you wont use even half of it.

thats a good point but my plan is to get to thousands of photos and thousands of videos, as an archive. It would really be time consuming.

also, you said you are downloading the videos from tiktok....most tiktok videos are already compiled compilations made of 10-20 mini clips ? how are you going to re-use them ?

if you planning to cut the single clips and re-arrange them into a new video, will take ages
