Any free AI real face generator

Topic: In need a bunch of real faces made by AI for my author pages.

After some research, I found the Canva free AI face generator looks really good.

I once tried generated.photos 1 year ago but the pricing is high and the face is not that amazing. Now I think there must be something better out there.

Does anyone have better suggestions? The image must be 100% real human looking and the model/service should be free, or dirty cheap for my use case.

Thanks!

I'll use thispersondoesnotexist as the last fallback if I can't find better options. Thanks for bringing it up! I almost forget about the gem site.

While Canva free AI faces are decent, try NightCafe's free tier for more realistic, human-looking portraits it offers customization options too

On the other hand, these are more options try Artbreeder and This Person Does Not Exist are excellent options

Topic: My friend once told me about This Person Does Not Exist. She said it’s free and makes very realistic faces with just one click. I have heard of Artbreeder too though some features cost a bit but I can’t really say much about it cause I never really used it.

Imagine if you used that and it actually came up with yourself. (like 99.99% likeness so impossible to differentiate).

I think my stomach would fall out of my arse.

I will probably go with thispersondoesnotexist, as upon checking, you can still spot an AI face image when generating faces for my use cases. You can tell it is an AI face when looking closely at the details of the clothing.
thispersondoesnotexist is more mature and you can find some perfect faces in the end.

Just a bit.

Save the image and use something like inpaint to remove the watermark.

Topic: This Person Does Not Exist is a website that generates a random, hyper-realistic face each time you refresh the page. The images are completely free to use, but you will not have control over the appearance of the face.
Fotor also has a free AI image generator that includes a feature for creating human faces. While it may not be as advanced as some paid options, it can still give some decent enough results.
