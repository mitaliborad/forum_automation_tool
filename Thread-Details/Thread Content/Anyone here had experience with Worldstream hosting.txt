So, is Hetzner storage box or Worldstream file storage good for adult streaming video storage purposes? I heard Hetzner kicked out some people for it, and others are managing somehow. I don't know about Worldstream file storage, as there's nothing mentioned about it. I don't even know the price. Do you have any idea?
