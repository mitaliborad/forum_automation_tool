Topic: I remember years ago when you could pay someone that had a tweet deck with big accounts on it to all retweet your tweet and it would drive a lot of traffic to your page.

Is something like that still around?

I know you can buy retweets that are from accounts with either botted followers or very low followers, but back in like 2017 or so you could buy retweets from people that have a tweet deck connected to a lot of poplar real accounts and they would retweet your tweet from all of those accounts

Topic: Panels are still at thing and for most parts, still work. You mileage with them now is gonna be far from how effective they used to be though plus the recent sharp drop on bot follows. That specific feature you're looking for, you can try checking around the Marketplace section for panels that may offer it.
