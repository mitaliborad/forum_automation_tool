Topic: Hi,

I have been looking for a week, I searched throughout the web but didn't get information. So, I am here to get some guidance.

My question is that are there any courses, techniques, or paid communities available where I can learn advanced puro blackhat SEO or advanced greyhat SEO?

Please suggest to me.

Thank you in advance.

I am looking for something advance strategy (Pure Blackhat) that I can learn from. I f I want a 500k+ traffic in 2 months, what will be the method?? I want these types of strategies. I know Google will ban the websites but still I want to learn because it is my career concerned. I am ready to pay someone who teaches me, any courses available, or paid communities available. I am eager to learn these types of strategies. You can DM privately if anyone really helps me out.
