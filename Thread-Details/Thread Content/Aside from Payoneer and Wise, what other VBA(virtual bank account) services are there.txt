Wise and Payoneer need KYC a different thing is that you can fake the process, but you can do this pretty much with any bank under the sun with the risks it has associated.

There are not many places to get a VBA without real KYC

I dont need to collect many payments, just the one payment that ebay UK uses to verify your account

I think they send a 5p test payment and you have to give the reference code in the description

I'm confused as what will the account be used for then?

Any VBA provider will ask for purpose and some level of KYB.

Like I said ebay required account number and sort code to send a test dummy payment, with a code in the description you have to give them back

With Fake Name, you have no options. We're in 2025 not 2000 where everything was "possible".
