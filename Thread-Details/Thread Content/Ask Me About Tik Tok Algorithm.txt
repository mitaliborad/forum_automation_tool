I’d also love to hear what’s working for you—let’s share ideas and strategies! The new year is here, so let’s crush those goals

only one, the biggest profile that is being monetized and that is a digitals service business so people click the link sign up with zero ad spend just tik tik alone we generated 33k in sales in 4 months

Don`t focus too much on volume focus on content that is original and the algo likes really there is not a way to post everyday multiple times with original algo friendly content takes too much time

what kind of hooks or techniques do you use to grab attention (high retention) and keep people watching?

Which is better, short views or long videos?

Which niche did you get most success?

I use controversial hooks to engage comments and people to share all my videos I'm convinced in my head that tik tok loves controversial content and the algorithm is designed to push that in the USA. the results confirm what i think.


i found the perfect amount time for a video is 30-45 seconds MAX

The niche i found most success in whats sports niche i like to focus on a niche i can create content for easily

only time you should be buying engagement is if the account is fresh with no following after you build at least 1000 followers the algo should work for you

I'm using DHP tool to reup tiktok, but out of 50 channels I post, only 1-2 channels are trending, the rest only stop at 4-500 views, can you advise me on how to solve it?

tik tok is weird because the warm up period doesnt matter in my own research really just matters how the new profile registers with the algorithm i will create 2-3 accounts for the same niche and make sure least one of the accounts is hitting FYP no issue then start growing .

all my content is faceless i just grab content from twitter and use cap cut to edit to make it different and friendly for tik tok algo

i honeslty have never hit this roadblock so i don`t have an issue with that . you shouldnt be having this issue at the start of the account your account is either a good account that hits FYP or it doesnt get any views if the account is not getting any views just dump it and create new one

i would just dump the profiles that are not breaking the 500 views mark or focus on making your content more orginal and algo friendly . most likely its your content but tik tok is simple if the account is not bringing it views just dump it a fresh new profile

i havent had this issue im in the usa and have 2-3 cellphones myself for work so i just use my own numbers to create profiles but it should be that hard to find good proxy provider sadly good proxies cost money and alot proxy sellers are not the best its just trial and error.

I'm convinced tik tok algo has features that organically boost anything controversial every post that is controversial gets avg 300k-1million views no problem
