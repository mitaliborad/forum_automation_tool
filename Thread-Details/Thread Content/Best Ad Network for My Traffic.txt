Topic: I have been in the same boat with APK traffic, and most mainstream networks either reject the site or pay peanuts. The ones that worked best for me are PopAds, PropellerAds, Zeropark, HilltopAds, and AdMaven. If CPMs are still low, try direct CPI offers from AdscendMedia, OGAds, or CPABuild—they tend to convert better for APK-related traffic.

Try with an AdManager network. AdManager doesn't limit you like AdSense does, and if your website has a problem, the network usually contacts you before limiting you and tells you what the problem is.

Maybe if you post here on Want to Buy or Hire a Freelancer, they'll help you find an AdManager network.

Topic: For a niche like APK downloading, choosing the right ad networks is crucial. Here are some suggestions:
PopAds: This network offers high CPC (cost per click) and could be a good fit for APK download sites. It generally provides good payouts and works well with high-traffic websites.
ExoClick: This is a popular ad network and could be a great option for sites with niche content, like APK downloads. It's compatible with app download ads.
MGID: MGID is good for app-based sites like APK downloads. They tend to provide good payouts for paid traffic.
AdMaven: Known for working well with popular but niche categories, AdMaven could be a good match for APK download sites.
TrafficStars: This network delivers high-quality traffic and targets the audience for app downloads effectively.
Each network has its own terms and conditions, so testing a few of them to find the best fit for your website might be beneficial. Additionally, optimizing ad types based on your site's content and traffic is key.

Topic: It depends on your traffic sources and niche. If AdSense isn’t an option, try Ezoic or Mediavine (if you meet their traffic requirements). For tier-3 traffic, networks like PropellerAds or MGID might work better.

Use Ezoic or AdSense. You shouldn't have any problems with them.
