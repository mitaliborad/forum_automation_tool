you can use chatgpt, grook, deepseek any smart tool, but you need to write like act like specialist of your field and then tool will react as specialist of that field.

Grook lol. I missed that. "Grok" is actually very helpful for feedback and assessing any questions or answers you may have. I use Grok now for most tasks and it will definitely refine your communications skills more so than other AI tools with more detailed and applicable insights compared to GPT or Deepseek.

Topic: From what I have experienced, prompting the mainstream tools will give you better results than any specific AI Interview Practice tools most likely. Just have to take the time to prompt it correctly for the results you would like to acheive otherwise it's an open world and AI will run wild if not prompted correctly.
