Topic: HI everyone

Asking the people that are used to stripe or have some experience with it

Since stripe is only geo restricted, for the people that are buying them what challenges do you face with it?

Do they always monitor your payments from the first purchases or how is it done?

Where do you usually buy stripe, is there a section in BHW for that?

any idea if these accounts last?

I would say that algorithm does everyting automatically, and they have probably a lot of red flags from sarts.
-Type of company (the easier it is to create than the more fucked up stripe is, so UK location is a problem, but HK seems to be good)


Uniqpayments can provide it for you.

Topic: Stripe is strict from the begging. They start to monitor everything since you just apply to open an account. And they will be checking first purchases as well.
