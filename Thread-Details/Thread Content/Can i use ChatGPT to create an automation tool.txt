Topic: Sure it can. I created many myself. Including some social media bots in Puppeteer, scrapers, automated website, etc... Keep in mind that not every solution will be good, you'll have to tweak the AI code a bit.

Topic: The possibilities of AI are vast, and I have explored them myself by building a variety of tools, including social media bots, crawlers, and automated websites. However, it is important to understand that no solution is perfect from the start. Customizing and tweaking AI code is an essential part of the process.
