Topic: A 403 Forbidden error can occur for a number of reasons, including a mistyped URL, a browser cache that needs to be cleared, or a faulty plugin or You can contact your Internet Service Provider (ISP).

Also try Temporarily disable your VPN: A VPN can trigger a 403 Forbidden error if the website blocks access from VPN servers.

actually its servers IP blacklisted, temp solution can be adding proxy on ubuntu/debian server and run apt update and install mongodb. after that remove proxy from server

Topic: If everything above is right, have you check the .htaccess file? Do you have uploaded and unzipped already a web - app project?

Why do i ask? If you have your project in your public/html and you are trying to access to your website i.e yourwebsite . Com and the server returns 403 forbidden it might be your website htaccess file , edit - remove or rename and test again.

If your issue persists , did you check your console error log? Could be folder permissions , a missing file or just that the mongodb is not installed .

Your CMS is important to know here , with Laravel you can use APP_DEBUG to check what your issues
What CMS you are currently using?

its nothing to do with CMS or any script. server is new, legit new new. thing is that IP from server was banned. i just needed to add proxy to update and get package active and installed.
