Topic: I've abandoned my Tumblr blogs as I couldn't get much value out of them. I considered it to be a waste of time. It might still work for some niches, but it's not as relevant as it once used to be. It's better to stick to mainstream platforms.

I use "Link" option for posting. Tumblr generates image thumbnail from my website's post and scrapes title. When somebody clicks on thumb he will be redirected from tumblr to my website

Driving traffic from Tumblr can be challenging. Focus on quality content that resonates with your niche. Engage with the community by reblogging and commenting on relevant posts. Building genuine connections can help increase website visits over time.
