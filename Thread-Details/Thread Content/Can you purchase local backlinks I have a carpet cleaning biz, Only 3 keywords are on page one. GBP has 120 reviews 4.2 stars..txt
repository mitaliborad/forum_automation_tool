Topic: I have citations, seo optimized site, its about 4 years old. How do I take this to the next level. Will geting a seo package from a reputable seller on market place benefit me? Ever since my rating dropped to 4.2 from 4.7, the phones been quiet. It was one customer leaving fake reviews from their family accounts spamming 1 stars. Im still on contact with google trying to get them removed.

Topic: other than backlinks I don't know what else you can do (SEO-wise I mean).

You could try ranking in other search engines (Bing and DDG for example) for stuff like "carpet cleaning near me", or "carpet cleaning in NY" (or whatever your location is), and you could use an EMD as I've heard that EMDs get favorable treatment from these search engines. So, you would buy an EMD (ohiocarpetcleaning.com if you operated in Ohio for example) and optimize the homepage for the keyword "Ohio Carpet Cleaning", and then make blog posts (2-5 per week), for keywords like "carpet cleaning near me", "cheap carpet cleaning Ohio", "carpet cleaning services in Ohio", etc and link from these posts to your homepage (or to the Services page) so you can build up this page's authority and start ranking for whichever keyword you target.

And yeah, you would end up having 2 different websites for the same service, but many people compete against themselves to dominate the SERPs for certain keywords, so you won't be wasting too much (money / time) doing this, it's basically just another domain name (I assume you already have hosting so you won't be paying extra for this) and maybe some initial website / logo design if you can't do it yourself... oh, and also some money to make content for the blog posts, but with the AI madness going on nowadays you can probably churn out 100s of pieces of content for like $10-20 a month, so it's not very expensive...

Other than this, maybe your other option (which I think it's good too) is to provide services so good and cheap that people will spread the word and when you have a loyal base of repeat customers you don't need SEO anymore... and people will leave positive reviews on your GBP on their own, which will - indirectly - do more SEO for your site than what you're doing yourself

Also, don't limit yourself to SEO only. If you have money / possibilities, try advertising in local forums and magazines, even in ezines / newsletters if you can afford / you know good ezines / newsletters.

Again, the ultimate goal is to build up a decent amount of loyal (returning) customers who will want your services each month / year so you can get a constant flow of income and then people will start recommending you to others and you'll also make enough money to branch into other advertising platforms so you don't rely on SEO all the time...

Anyway, if you're determined to stick with SEO then - besides citations that you said you already have - backlinks and reviews are probably your best options I can think of...

Well, you can try creating a new site or try to improve that one with better on page seo and more backlinks. Also, you should try running some google ads and get more leads.

Topic: I agree, if we take into account only SEO, then a large number of backlinks can improve the situation, but the backlinks must be of high quality.
You can try placing backlinks on niche forums, or contact the admins to buy advertising on local and niche forums.

Thank you everyone for the replies. Im just trying to figure out what to do here. Really appreciate you guys taking the time. I notice my competiotos have backlinks from sites like yahoo finance, home and garden, forbes, the Ktchn etc. How exactly are thyey getting these high DA sites to article them and link their site too? Is this worth looking into?
