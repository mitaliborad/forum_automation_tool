Case Study: Mass Adding Followers to Close Friends

Topic User: ParroxPAW
Topic: For the past 2 weeks I’ve been playing around with the effects of adding your whole following to close friends. So far I’ve seen amazing results from a business getting 5x the story views and this dead 135k account getting almost 10 times as many story views from 849 to 7,733 and gaining followers for the first time this year. Has anyone played around with it?

I am so far able to add around 20k followers per day. Doing a case Study now with some larger accounts (1m) so will report back on how many I can add over an extended period of time.

so far each story has performed similarly on all the accounts Ive tried it on. There is definitely some fall-off, but you are also continuously adding new followers so the list is always being refreshed.

How do you add 20k followers a day, do you buy 20k followers a day?

I add 20k of my own followers to close friends per day.

So if I have an acc with 200k followers, takes around 10 days to add them all to close friends

Topic: So is the idea that the green ring is more eye catching? They may hit it once out of curiosity because who ever sees the green ring but will it really keep up? Curious to see how long the boost lasts

Topic: I was under the impression that close friends vs regular follow is relative. Meaning, if all of them are close friends, it's like none of them are.

I think the results you see in story views are related to following so many new users vs adding them as close friends.

Well yeah because the point is you can post things to close friends only but if everyone is a close friend then everyone sees it so no one's really a close friend, but the post should still appear with a green ring to get their attention

Topic: Its an interesting technique, very creative. I have never heard or thought about it before.

Im not sure It would work for linear growth, but maybe to re-activate old big accounts, or maybe just to keep re-freshening your accounts. Since the day you add people to best friends, you will get a lot more views, this engagement may be positive for the account overall, boosting its posts maybe.

Keep updating, thanks for sharing

The other way around. If you are in their close friend it's circled in green, if you are the only one adding them to your close friends it changes nothing.

Eh?
That doesn't sound right. If I add someone to my close friends, then I post a picture that only my close friends can see, others don't get to butt there way into that. I've seen OF types use it to give exclusives on their instead.

I thought the whole point was them trying to get rid of finstas by letting you do it on one acc

Oh lol, I was ready to believe you that it was the other way around because I've never used it personally. Like WTF kind of useless feature would that be? XD

I was speaking about viewing stories from your closed friends while you were talking about stories you only publish to your closed friends.
Both have a green ring, by the way.

It marks them green for you even though it's not special? Well that's silly, way to go Instagram.

Your stories have a green ring in these two conditions:
1. You added them to close friends and publish a story exclusively to them.
2. They added you to close friends.
Both are kinda special, and for my understanding, you found an exploit in the first.
