Could BMT be the next big project?

Topic: Most tokens get listed without a solid project, which leads to the failure of the token, hence the dump without revival.

For a while now, I've been looking for ways to analyze new token launches and identify centralization risks and eventually saw a platform that specializes in analyzing token distribution and wallet connections through interactive bubble visualizations, making it easier to understand token ownership patterns and identify potential risks.

Their official token, $BMT, which has secured significant backing funds of €6.5M since 2023 till date from a mix of blockchain protocols, will be listed soon on Bitget.

What do you think about the project cause for me I feel we need things like this in the crypto space.

Topic: You make a great point about token launches often lacking solid projects, leading to inevitable failure. A platform that helps analyze token distribution and wallet connections through visual tools sounds like a game-changer, especially for identifying centralization risks early. If $BMT has already secured €6.5M in backing, it shows strong support. I'll definitely keep an eye on its listing on Bitget. The crypto space definitely needs more transparency and focused tools like this
