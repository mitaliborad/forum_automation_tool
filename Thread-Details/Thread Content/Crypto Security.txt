Crypto Security

Topic: Crypto access relies on a 12-word phrase from a 2048-word set—seems secure. I know the odds of brute-forcing it are tiny, but still, I can’t help but wonder: what if quantum computers eventually crack it? Is there a guarantee our crypto stays safe, or is it a ticking time bomb? What do you think?

Topic: Couldn't they increase the word set from 2048 to 8192 if necessary? There are already wallets with 24-words seedphrase.

Anyway, new technologies would emerge to protect crypto assets

Topic: Usable quantum computers that can run Shor’s Algorithm at the scale needed to break ECC are not here yet.
Real estimates for this level of capability range from 10–30 years, and that’s assuming the tech progresses as hoped.

only if they move assets
old assets will always be vulnerable iirc

for quantum computers it will make no difference 2048 or 8192 or any other number, but there are different algorithms that are quantum calculations proof
