Topic: as long as backlinks work PBNs will continue working (but the quality PBNs, of course, not the carelessly built ones)

Topic: of course they do. backlinks are still the #1 ranking factor so naturally pbns are still very much relevant. as always their effectiveness and longevity depends on the quality/quantity of inbound (the higher the better) and the number of outbound links (the lower the better).

Topic: A PBN can pass you link juice, but you must be cautious. If the backlinks aren’t properly managed, they could harm your websites. Not all PBNs are equal, as a seo expert, do your research and only work with effective and trustworthy networks.

Topic: I’m sure they work but I’d only use them if I owned them tbh. At least then the quality can be controlled in terms of backlinks and content quality. Otherwise I’d prefer guest post outreach.

You need a mix. It's been if you own them and can control the quality of your PBNs as the algorithm changes. Make sure they are not connected to each other through the Google suite and have different VPNs

Topic: PBNs still work in 2025, but only when done right. Low-quality setups get caught fast. I use clean, well-built sites with unique content and zero footprints. Slow link rollout, natural anchors, and mixing with niche edits and authority building keeps it safe and effective.
