Do follow PR backlink from HA Websites?

Topic: I tried some high authority pr backlinks. I mainly did it because i wanten some high DR backlinks for the linkprofile on that inner page. It s more likely you get other backlinks this way.

Anyway. What is the worth of do-follow pr backlinks in terms of rankings?

It also seems that some are created on different sections than the normal categories. I suspect it's the same value as a high DR community backlink. Which is almost nothing

What's your take on this?

Topic: PR's almost never consist of do-follow. A standard PR is just an article uploaded, with no follow links, and a lot of the times that PR gets archived or removed after sometime, therefore the cheap cost. Popular PR sites like: BusinessInsider, yahoo, APnews, marketwatch, digital journal, benzinga etc. Google tends to downplay the impact of mass press release backlinks since theyâ€™re often placed in areas that receive little indexing or fail to pass significant link equity.

A do-followlink on those sites is just considered a backlink, they upload an article on the same website, but instead it offers do-follow, so it's not just a PR

Topic: I consider them a good starting point, similar to social profiles.

They can contribute to trust and brand building a little but don't expect much else from them.

Most likely won't push a keyword up if that's what you's asking.

Topic: If backlinks are placed on relevant pages of a highly authoritative domain, they can definitely help, especially if those pages are properly indexed and have traffic. Links from real community-oriented sites with solid engagement are generally more effective than random PR links, even if the DR is high.

Topic: High-authority PR backlinks may have a short-term impact on rankings in some cases, but their long-term value is limited, especially when they appear in non-editorial content.
