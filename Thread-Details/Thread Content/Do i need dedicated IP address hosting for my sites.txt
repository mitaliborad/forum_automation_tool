Topic: Hi

I have a site and soon i will have another one in the same niche but with different images, product and meta descriptions. Sites are with woocommerce and i was thinking getting host for woocommerce with chemicloud which is cheaper version of hosting. Do i need dedicated IP address for each of my site so i wont get penalized by google and wont hurt SEO or i can go with my small budget with the cheaper version which is wordpress woocommerce hosting?

Thanks

Topic: you do not need a dedicated IP, the main thing is that the speed of the site was normal, the content is unique and useful
but make sure your hosting can handle the load
a lot of sites hang on the same IP, but they are not blocked

But if you're managing multiple projects, doing SEO-heavy work, or building a PBN, a dedicated IP can help keep things clean and isolated. It's more about control and avoiding bad IP neighbors than any direct SEO boost.

Topic: No, no need for dedicated IP really.
There are benefits which does include isolate your site from others on a shared hosting server which does reduce the risk of being cross-site contaminated or shared server vulnerabilities.
Your "email" if ran off the server, may have better deliverability and what not.
But there also the increase cost too
