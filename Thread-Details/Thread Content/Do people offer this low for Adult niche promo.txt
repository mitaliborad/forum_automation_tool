Topic: I've been going back and forth with someone wanting me to promote their Adult niche website, but i was shocked that he's trying to only offer me $30/week for multiple posts per day + pinned tweets



for reference, i'm getting +8 million impressions per month on that account alone...

Are people offering and accepting these low amounts for real or is he just bluffing?

I dont work in that niche but working in another niche with alot of lowballers I will tell you, dont accept low ball offers if you know/think your account is worth alot more. You will get the good deals eventually.

If they want to advertise this type of content it's because there's some value.
Ask them what website it is and just clone one for yourself. Gl

Topic: Wow, $30/week for that level of exposure seems incredibly low, especially considering your account’s impressive reach of 8+ million impressions per month. It’s possible they’re undervalue your influence.
We also work in the adult niche and understand the value of a targeted audience like yours—it’s a premium space, and the rates should reflect that. Accounts with your level of visibility can command significantly higher fees, especially for consistent posting and pinned tweets.

Topic: Yeah, you have to put your foot down when it comes to lowball offers. Meet half-way at most but never sell yourself short or you lose quite a lot of leverage on your deals moving forward.

Why not promote your own offers? You could make more than $30 a day.

Topic: Wow, that sounds crazy low for that many impressions. I'd definitely hold out for something way better than that.
