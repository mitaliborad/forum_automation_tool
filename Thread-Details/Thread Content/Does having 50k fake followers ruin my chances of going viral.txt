Does having 50k fake followers ruin my chances of going viral?

Topic: I’ve got a question that’s been on my mind and I’d love to hear your thoughts.


So basically, my account has around 50k followers - but most of them are fake (bought them a while ago, kinda regretting it now). I’ve started taking content creation seriously and I’m posting 3 reels a day consistently, trying to go viral organically.


My question is:
Does having that many fake followers actually hurt my chances of going viral on platforms like Instagram or TikTok?
And if yes, does that mean I basically have no shot with this account anymore? Or is there still hope if I just stay consistent and keep putting out good content?

Topic: yes it can affect you
here is the thing:
if you already had a decent amount of follower and then a couple of bots came in nobody can point the fingers at you
i mean anyone could have bought fake followers in an attempt to ruin your account right ?
but if 90% of your followers are bots i think the algorithm picked that up already and this is the reason your content is under performing
my advice: create new account, be serious, grow organically as much as you can, inflate posts or stats with caution

Appreciate your answer. Anything I have to be aware of when starting a new one? do i have to warm it up, if so, how?
