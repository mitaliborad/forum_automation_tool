Topic: Is Your Pinterest Pin Indexed on Google? Let’s Find Out!
I recently made a surprising discovery—most of my Pinterest pins are not indexed on Google! Curious? You can check yours too!

How to Check:
Simply search on Google using this format:

site:https://in.pinterest.com/pin/(your-pin-id)

If your pin appears in the search results, congratulations! You can drive traffic to it directly from Google.

This pin is for the example -




I checked one of my old pins (2 years old), and guess what? It’s still not indexed!






Your turn!
Now it’s up to you—find a way to get your pins indexed and unlock more traffic!

Have insights or tips? Share them below!

Thank you!

Being indexed on Google is an added bonus but not the main goal with Pinterest marketing . Unless you're using Pinterest marketing, in which case getting your pin indexed and ranking should be priority. For most Pinterest marketers who have done their niche research and keyword research very well, Pinterest traffic is enough as it is much more targeted.
