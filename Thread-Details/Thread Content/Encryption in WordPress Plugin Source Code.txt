Encryption in WordPress Plugin Source Code

Total comments in the thread: 1

Topic User: Xizovrenia
Topic: Hey guys, I'm currently learning how to create a WordPress plugin. Is there an effective method to encrypt or at least obfuscate the plugin's source code so that users can't easily peek into it? I've tried a few methods (including this one https://github(dot)com/pH-7/Obfuscator-Class) but I keep running into errors.

If anyone knows a good solution, please share it in the comments. Thanks!
