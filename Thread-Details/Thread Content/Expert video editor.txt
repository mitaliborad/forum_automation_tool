Topic: It's general best to create personal brand around your work using your face, it's make you look way more trustful, and creating any "educational" content will attract people from the same industry, also cold reach works grat if you have something to show. Keep in mind that there is not anything like "expert video editor" outside cinema/movies, video editing is extremly simple, and extremly saturated by people from 3rd word countires with very low rates.
