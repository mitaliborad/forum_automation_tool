Topic: spam filters from email providers probably do keep some kind of reputation score for a domain, but i think they rely more heavily on the server’s ip address. they might also pay attention to changes in domain registration details.

i’d guess they reset reputation for expired domains long ago. although i have seen spam in my inbox (well, in the spam folder) clearly sent from expired domains.

you can find these kinds of domains on auctions (godaddy, namecheap, etc.) or even for free on expireddomains.net. but honestly, if you don’t know how to properly check a domain, it’s easy to end up with one that was already used for spamming.

Nothing bad about buying these domains as long as they are a good reputation. Don't buy inactive domains especially ones with long time inactivity. You can search on GoDaddy or Google Domains, both offer expired domains for sale.
