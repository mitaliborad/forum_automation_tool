Extra Phones vs. Personal Phone

Total comments in the thread: 13

Topic: i’ve got a few extra phones and i’ve made several ig accounts on them, but they all flop.

on my personal phone, i’ve made like 30 accounts over time and they do pretty good.

could it be that my extra phones dont do as well because i dont use them as much?

i don't understand

thanks!

I am getting accounts suspended on new iphones 12 (3 seperate phones), each with its own mobile data plan, using fresh icloud mails each time. I get suspended immediately after creating the account. What could be the problem?

Do you need to reset your phone after each creation?

Topic: Yes, your backup phone is likely to be underperforming due to some factors, and the key issue may be the lack of activity in these accounts.
