Topic: Just want to let you all guys know not to use this website ever again and do not sell or buy anything there.

Was trying to buy a specific account on Fameswap.com for a very high price. Immediately after I topped up the balance ($4900) I was banned by the administration of the website. MEssaged to the support, but I do not think this will help in any way.

Please spread the message about these scammers!!!

And share in this thread if you ever was scammed there or have negative experiences with this or other similar websites.

Thanks,
ML

Topic: Thanks for the warning. Fameswap has been known for shady stories for years, especially with high-value deals. $4900 is a serious loss.

If the support team doesnâ€™t respond, definitely try to request a chargeback through your payment method.
