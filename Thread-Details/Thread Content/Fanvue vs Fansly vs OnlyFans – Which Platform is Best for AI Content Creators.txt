Fanvue vs Fansly vs OnlyFans – Which Platform is Best for AI Content Creators

Total comments in the thread: 15

Topic User: vancci dfans xyz
Topic: I started on OnlyFans about a year ago. Initially, everything went fine, but as I got deeper into AI content creation, I felt that the platform was limiting me. I switched to Fanvue for a while, and while it was better for content freedom, I still had to deal with submitting personal IDs and copyright documents every time I posted something AI-generated.

Here’s how they compare:

OnlyFans has the largest user base and the highest willingness to pay. However, we all know that KYC is a hassle, creator accounts are expensive, and the content policies are the strictest here.
Fanvue claims to be the most AI-friendly platform, but even it is tightening its policies and still requires ID verification. Especially when I don’t trust the privacy protection of any platform, I’m worried about when my face and ID photos might be leaked. It’s dangerous, and I don’t want anyone to know that I’m doing this. But now, I’ve found a better solution.

Topic: In that case, I’m truly impressed and tip my hat to your level of expertise. If you’re able to publish content on OnlyFans that’s entirely AI-generated, your knowledge surpasses 99% of the users. You’re in a position not to ask questions but to teach others. I’m serious.

The problem is not posting AI content, everyone can do that and get away with it.

The real problem is for how much time you can get away with it.

As he says, OF creator accs are not cheap and sometimes they catch its AI so fast you dont even get to cash out.

Yes, an account ban can wipe everything out.

Their staff explicitly told me that deepfake and face swap are strictly prohibited on their platform, and AI-generated content will be labeled. I’ve already found a better platform than theirs. However, their service is not bad.

Topic: Fanvue and OnlyFans forbidden AI
I know that some people had some success doing that on Fanvue, but it's risky, it's against their ToS
Not sure about Fansly, it seems a smaller alternative

Nothing beats OnlyFans in terms of user base, reach and CVR though.
