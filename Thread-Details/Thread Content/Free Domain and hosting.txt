Topic: Hi, what are your goals, experience level, or can you give more specifics? Is it just a landing page or bigger site, focus on seo or email collection, traffic amount expected, etc? There are many options but each have pros and cons.

Wordpress.com or google sites is example possibly of what you are looking for, but cant be sure without more details.

Topic: don't do that man...those free hosting services will probably ban you and you will just lose your time and effort
invest a few bucks in a shared hosting, the cheapest that you found and it's better

Topic: free hosting is so bad it's not even worth the trouble. And free domain you can only get with paid hosting usually, so yeah... I don't think you'll find what you want

Just put aside $5 a month to buy shared hosting (although, you'll probably be charged yearly), this will get you started really well.... Or, if you know you will only need 1 domain ever you can try HostKoala's $5 / year Direct Admin plan, it can't get any cheaper than this when it comes to good paid hosting....

If you still wish to waste your time and mental energy with free hosting let me know and I'll post a few options here, but honestly, you'll have more headaches with free hosting than it's worth the trouble

Topic: You can try Wix, Weebly, or WordPress.com for free website building with free domain options (e.g., yoursite.wixsite.com).

Hi, testterghost. Free domains are not so good. Fee domain extensions such as .tk, .ml usually give an unprofessional impression and may affect the credibility and image of your brand. Using such domain names may make visitors feel that your site is not reliable enough. And search engines may give lower rankings to free domain names because these domain names tend to be easily abused, leading search engines to trust them less.
