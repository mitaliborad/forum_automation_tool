Topic: Hi everyone,
I have a movie website and I used to use doodstream and filemoon as my #1 and #2 player. However, after doodstream went down, I suddenly thought: Is it possible that Filemoon will also go down in the future? So now I want to ask you guys to recommend some hosting platforms that you feel are okay so that I can use them instead.

Topic: If you want to earn money from views, you can use: Earnvids, StreamHG, VidGuard, PilePV,... But the downside is that there will be at least 3 ads appearing
If you want to install ads yourself or want less ads, you can consider using RPMShare, Upnshare,...

We like to partner with uploaders directly. How much traffic do you have daily? Which countries is this traffic from?

Message us and we can probably work a deal out together

Topic: What is your main goal for a hosting service? Each platform has its own strengths.
The best method is to check which player your competitors are using and follow their approach.

Who knows when it will collapse again, it's too risky to continue trusting
