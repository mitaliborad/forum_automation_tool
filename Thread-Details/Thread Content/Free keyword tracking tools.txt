I'm looking for a free keyword tracking tool, or at the very least ultra-cheap one.

I've come across a seemingly free app based on GSC data - Jaysearch (https:// jaysearch. com/. Has anyone tried it? If it's so good, why it's free?

Any alternatives are welcome
Could you please explain what a good price would be?
I've been working on coding such a platform for some time now in my free time.

Always thought about having a very cheap option for small clients.
How much would you consider "cheap" for say... 50 keywords?
Would $30 / year be cheap enough?

Free QR tools don't work very well, SEMrush tools work much better.

JaySearch is a free keyword tracking tool using Google Search Console (GSC) data. It offers daily position updates and helps SEOs monitor rankings. It's likely free to attract users and improve the tool. Alternatives include SEO PowerSuite, WordStream's Free Keyword Tool, Ahrefs Keyword Generator, and Ubersuggest. For ultra-cheap options, Keyword.com starts at $3/month.
