Topic: Free traffic is hard.
You need to do hundreds of experiments or get professional support before you can get started right away. This is expensive gold

Hey, can you tell me a little bit more about this method, please?
Should I create my own reels related to my topic, include link to my blog, hashtags and thats it? My blog url shorten with some FB accepted url shortener?
How many reels is good to post per 1 day from 1 FB account?
Thank you for the answer!

Try a mix of popular and niche-specific hashtag, and use a URL shortener that is accepted by Facebook

Topic: There are tons of free traffic methods that still work in 2025. It requires you to spend time learning and testing them out. People are saying seo is dead yet i just got some free blogspot blogs ranked and make bank off them. People are sayig facebook is dead and i'm still making bank from free pages and groups. Focus on 1 strategy them completely immerse yourself in it. Test the shit out if it. If you still cant get it to work. Dont jump around from idea to idea. The old saying "more things change the more they stay the same" isnt more than than ever before. To pplaces are Youtube shorts and tiktok are still killing it right now for me. Pinterest is still killing it for me right now also and even classified ad sites are still doing very well for me.

When I post FB reels or selfr videos with my face on it , 2-3 minutes length and share it to multiple related niche groups, that should gain a good organic reach traction and traffic to my external site I guess? The faceless model on the other side, you need tons of videos toget good traction and for that all video AI's in the price range of $25 monthly will here not help, too much restrictions, to make tons of faceless videos such an video AI will cost you $100 monthly or more, then edit each of your scenes will deduct the money you have uploa dto them- too much restrictions.
