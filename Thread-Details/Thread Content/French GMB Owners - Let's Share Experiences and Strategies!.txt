Topic: Hey everyone,

I’m currently managing multiple Google My Business (GMB) profiles across different regions in France, covering niches such as landscaping, construction, and roofing. As GMB plays a crucial role in local SEO, I wanted to open up a discussion to share experiences, insights, and best practices specifically tailored to the French market.

If you're also working on optimizing GMB listings in France, I'd love to hear your thoughts on topics such as:
Effective strategies to improve GMB visibility and local rankings
Handling GMB suspensions and reinstatements
The impact of recent updates on local search performance
Citation building and local link-building tactics
Managing and responding to customer reviews effectively
I believe there's a lot we can learn from each other by discussing what has worked (or hasn't) in the French market. Let's collaborate, share tips, and support each other in navigating the ever-changing landscape of local SEO.

Looking forward to exchanging ideas with you all!

Salut,

Avec un ami, on bosse sur le SEO local et on serait vraiment intéressés pour échanger avec toi. On optimise des fiches GMB en France et on teste pas mal de techniques pour améliorer le classement et la stabilité des points.

Si tu es ouvert à partager quelques insights, on pourrait comparer nos approches et voir comment chacun gère ses fiches. On a peut-être des infos qui pourraient t’être utiles, et inversement. Dis-moi si ça te tente !
