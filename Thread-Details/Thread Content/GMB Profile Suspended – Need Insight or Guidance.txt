GMB Profile Suspended – Need Insight or Guidance

Total comments in the thread: 6

Topic: Hello

I’m hoping someone here can provide some insight or direction. Last week, my Google My Business profile was suddenly suspended without any clear reason. I’ve hired a freelance company to help with GMB management, but I personally review and approve all content before anything is posted.

We’re a legitimate, service based business, fully registered as an LLC with the state. The business name on the profile is our actual legal name, with no keyword stuffing or violations that I can identify. There haven’t been any changes to the listing recently (no updates to hours, address, or other info), and all the posts simply highlight our services and provide helpful industry tips.

When I received the initial suspension notice, it mentioned that one of the profiles didn't follow the guidelines. In response, I immediately removed the external manager from the account and submitted an appeal.

Unfortunately, the appeal was denied. The latest message states:
“Content that violates our policies on deceptive content and behavior isn't allowed. Deceptive content intentionally misleads or deceives others.”
However, I’ve gone through everything and can’t find anything that fits that description.

If anyone has dealt with a similar situation or knows someone reputable who can assist, I’d be extremely grateful for your help or recommendations.

Thanks in advance!

That’s super frustrating especially when you’ve played by the rules. Sometimes GMB suspensions happen due to false flags or something the external manager did unknowingly. Since your appeal was denied, it might help to get a second set of eyes from a GMB expert who’s dealt with reinstatements.

Check out support groups or legit freelancers with solid reviews on Upwork or forums like Local Search Forum. You're not alone this happens more than it should.

Submit an appeal, afterwards it'll ask you to provide evidence. Upload a copy of your current LLC registration with the state with the business address.
A utility bill with the business name will help as well, but i've gotten profiles reinstated just with a DBA filing with the business address.

If someone logs in from a country far from your business location (even your freelancer!).
Freelancers/agencies sometimes accidentally cause issues (even just logging in from suspicious locations can trip Google's system).
If you hide your address but Google can’t verify you’re serving areas properly.
If your business category doesn't exactly match what you offer.
Too Many Posts With Calls-to-Action: Like "Call now" or "Get a free quote" spammed without much real "informative" content.

I hope this helps.
