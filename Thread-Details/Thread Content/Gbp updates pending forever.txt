Topic: I made a lot of updates to my Google my business profile and it's been pending for a couple of weeks for them to make the updates to my services. My service area my business name change added my address in there. Even though I have an online business, I'm doing digital marketing. Is there anything I can do to expedite this?

Topic: Is your business verified? I had the same problem with one of my GMB's but it's because it wasn't verified. Afterwards everything was updated pretty much instantly

Yeah it has been verified but I wonder because I made so many changes at once is why they are making me wait now but when I was making changes they were happening the same day
