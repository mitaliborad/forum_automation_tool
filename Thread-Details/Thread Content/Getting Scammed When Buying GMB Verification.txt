Getting Scammed When Buying GMB Verification

Total comments in the thread: 14

Topic User: perchboy
Topic: Hi guys, I have a few rank and rent pages and I'm looking to create more GMB's for harder categories like plumber and electricians.

I've paid 2 guys so far to verify my GMB pages but they get suspended after a couple days of them making it.

I'm willing to pay the money to get a GMB verified, but I want a page that will actually stay up.

Any recommendations on what I should do?

If the account is getting taken out, could be a competitor forcing you to reverify as well

You bought from a seller that is not allowed to sell as they are not upgraded. Next time, only buy from the BST or put your request in the WTB or HAF section.
