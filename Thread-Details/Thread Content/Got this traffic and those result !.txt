Topic: hi guys,

i have launched a Pinterest Blog since junuary in a specific niche
and managed to get 300k impression with 1.59k aoutbound clicks
my main traffic source is T1
i know it a small trafic to get some serious $
i have to monotise it before rise and repeat on another niche

got rejeceted from Adsense ( maybe because my content is AI generated )
and now trying Adsterra but nothing worth it, under $1/day for the 2 first days!
the ads are pop up with adsterra, i will wait for 1 week and see what happen

any other company to advertise with ?
what kind of format are you guys using ?

regards

If your content is AI, you'll struggle to find ad networks willing to accept your site. Mediavine journey was accepting almost everyone but they recently posted purged their network removing almost everyone.

using paid ads is a great start, you just have to wait for a few days maybe a week or so to see the results, another company that you can use to advertise with is Mediavine and SHE media, they have relatively high RPM's and can redirect traffic efficiently to your blog which means more visitors.
