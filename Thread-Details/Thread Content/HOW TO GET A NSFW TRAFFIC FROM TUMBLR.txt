When content is reported as NSFW, Tumblr will attempt to restrict or ban it for users who are in safe mode. If you don't designate it as NSFW, it may still appear in feeds that a particular user doesn't want to see.

Topic: Obviously you're no longer allowed to post hardcore NSFW stuff on tumblr so probably the best idea is to post "softcore" pictures/stuff that's sexy, not hardcore and allowed.
I would try that myself actually.
Now the question is how do you redirect traffic from Tumblr to a different proper adult website ? I don't think posting links would actually work.
