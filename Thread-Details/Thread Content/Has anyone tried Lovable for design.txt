Topic: Lovable is so fun for trying to map out what you can't figure out

Claude is great for code, but you can get nearly nowhere without the visual support... As always xumers mate, it's a tool not the answer

look at the criticism it gets and then you're happy days. a great mapping tool for you to use claude to build on

edit: i don't know about the newer updates buddy, but it was "great" when I had a go about 2-3 weeks back

Played with it a little. It gets you part of the way as a tool. I haven't been able to figure out how to complete and export a design to WP.

Topic: Yeah, Lovable can be a bit quirky, try rephrasing or adding more detail in your prompts to get better results.

I'm pretty sure my 5 page prompt of typed text had plenty of detail. It's not optimized to deliver turn-key Wordpress sites. I would categorize it as more of a tool, not a complete solution.

Topic: so how much are you going to spend on apps like lovable? that is the question that you should ask yourself. If you can build an app with like $600 spent in frameworks like Lovable, sure... it's worth a try
