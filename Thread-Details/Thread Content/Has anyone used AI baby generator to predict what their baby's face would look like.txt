Topic: Hello, everyone! I’m beyond excited and just had to share my joy across all platforms.
Here’s the big news: I’m pregnant!

My husband and I are finally going to have a baby, something we’ve been eagerly waiting for. I came across a tool on Reddit that predicts what your baby’s face might look like, and I couldn’t resist giving it a try.


The result is so cute!
I hope my baby looks like this in 8 months. But of course, no matter what they look like, I’ll love them endlessly.

I’m filled with excitement and happiness. Wishing all of you the same joy and fulfillment in your dreams!

This usually doesn't end well in most cases.

And one can always wait for 9 months.

What is exactly the point of this thread anyway?

so you're 1 month pregnant and you're expecting a 1 year old-looking baby in 8 months?


I expected a link to the (should I say your) tool, but I guess that no one asked for it yet. Maybe you should go back to the drawing board and improve your marketing pitch.
