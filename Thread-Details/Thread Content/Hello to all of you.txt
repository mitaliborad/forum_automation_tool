Topic: Hey everyone,
I'll briefly introduce myself - your everyday guy who's done a bit of selling Nutra stuff on the phone in call centers, then moved up to a manager position, helped affiliates and advertisers in some affiliate network, then tried to open my own network, bought paid adult / mainstream traffic and other stuff, promoted Dating offers, but it didn't work - I was spending most of my time at my day job. Also worked in online reputation management, which can be pretty lucrative, but I'm still searching for my ideal niche for ORM.

I suppose this forum is where I should have signed up a long time ago.

I'm on the lookout for opportunities to make decent money online without having to deal with linked.in again

Honestly, I'm not quite sure what else to add here, hope everyone has peace and plenty of "gold and silver".

Thanks for reply, I am currently carefully testing some free traffic for NSFW offers. I've been learning adjacent stuff for a few years and now I am slowly getting back into the affiliate game.

How are you acquiring the free traffic, if I may ask? Social media?

I've got a couple of twitter / x accounts. One is pretty standard, but the other one is NSFW and was getting 30000 views a week without me doing something. I thought about adding some kind of smartlink there at the last minute. I'm taking a look at the potential of social traffic and how I can improve clicks amount, making few more accounts etc.

X works well with NSFW stuff, but it's not easy. What kind of content are you uploading on the account that's getting 30K views per week? You should try rev-share webcam offers instead of dating offers.

There's a mix of HC content, GIFs, short videos, AI pics. I've been thinking about webcams, and I appreciate the suggestion.

Revshare webcam offers are pretty awesome. There are some successful journey threads here on the forum which you can chck out for more detailed info.

Do you include any hashtags and text in your tweets to increase the reach?
