I remember that it allows you to register an account by using a China Hong Kong mobile phone, which is easier to purchase than a mainland China mobile phone number.

Topic: Maybe you can registration via QQ International Client
You can search for "QQ International" on app stores or via search engines (e.g., Baidu) and install it.
Via QQ International
You can choose country code, and a foreign phone number to complete verification.
And for any issues, contact Tencent Customer Service, have a try bro.
