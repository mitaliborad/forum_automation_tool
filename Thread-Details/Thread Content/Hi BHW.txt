Topic: Hello everyone at BHW!

I'm Bruny. I just joined the community after lurking for too long. Been dabbling in digital marketing for a bit and figured it was time to actually connect with people who know their stuff.

Mainly interested in SEO and content strategies, but open to learning whatever I can pick up. Still pretty green in some areas but eager to learn.

Looking forward to chatting with you all and soaking up some knowledge!
