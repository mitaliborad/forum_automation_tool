Topic: If you're in a major city, you could sell pinned posts of local merchants. Go to them and show them what you have on Reddit and show the traffic numbers. Strike a realistic deal and they'll keep coming back if the traffic is good.

Topic: Most people would visit this subreddit before visiting Kenya, maybe post links with reliable accommodation or local SIM cards, think of something Kenyan visitors need, airport pickups? Anything in that realm

Topic: I agree with the travel offer suggestion. Are your members local or tourists? I'd also use offers for things that are locally sourced in Kenya. I mean a popular export of that country.

Topic: What do a lot of people in Kenya currently need? Think about it and if it is something like jobs or a service, you can find an affiliate program.

Topic: I've heard of a woman who rents out furniture and items such as travel cots, baby strollers and stuff out of airports. Pretty sure she went on Dragon's Den so alongside the great advice you've already received this would be a natural accompaniment to it

Topic: Post threads that target local businesses where the goal is asking for a recommendation.

For example 'best roofing in [city]' and then you can reach out to businesses and strike a deal for showing them at the top of the thread
