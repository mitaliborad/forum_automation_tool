How Defi Is Revolutionizing Lending And Borrowing

Topic: I'm convinced that 90% of people are unaware that borrowing money on the blockchain is a reality. Thanks to DeFi, platforms like Compound, Aave, and MakerDAO have made it possible for individuals to lend and borrow from each other, bypassing traditional banking systems that charge exorbitant interest rates. That’s why whenever I hear people say DeFi is dead, I just laugh. Recent projects emerging from the DeFi space clearly demonstrate a strong focus on building for the future. For instance, opportunities like locking BGB and DEUSD to receive a share of $ELX—courtesy of the new Bitget Launchpool for Elixir—are thriving within the ecosystem. And that’s not even mentioning other opportunities in DAO, Aave, and the modular decentralized finance protocol, $ELX. Don't sleep on DeFi. I suggest you explore it further.

Topic: Seriously, I feel you on that DeFi thing. It's wild how many people are clueless about borrowing and lending on the blockchain. Like, hello, Compound and Aave exist! It's not some futuristic fantasy, it's actually happening now and totally sidesteps those crazy bank fees. So when folks start saying DeFi is dead, I just roll my eyes. They're clearly not paying attention. There's so much cool stuff still popping up, like that Bitget Launchpool thing with BGB, DEUSD, and $ELX. I mean, who's going to say no to free crypto? Honestly, DeFi's got a lot of potential, even beyond just lending and borrowing. DAOs, Aave, and all those other projects, especially $ELX, they're building the future of finance. People need to wake up and see what's going on! You're right, definitely worth checking out.

Yes it is possible through DEFI, but you will have either Bitcoin or Eth to stand like collateral

The concept of revolutionizing our traditional route of lending and loaning financial instruments saw a great success when DeFi can into play, breaking the 3rd party protocol and ensuring customers protection and quick access.
Now, with help of DeFi and other trusted CEX like bitget, I could share from $2000 $ELX in community campaign for new users and also more to that if I choose to participate in the Poolx or candybomb event

Thanks for this comment because I thought I was the one that saw this most especially what the exchange and the project are doing. DEFI is not dead, but rather growing more than what people expect. And also about the launchpool I am participating also.

You can dyor on various liquidity pools, borrowing, lending staking. They're alot of them. Or there's a feature like that on Bitget called crypto loan. You can check if you meet the requirements. Pls do let me know if you need more details on the latter..
