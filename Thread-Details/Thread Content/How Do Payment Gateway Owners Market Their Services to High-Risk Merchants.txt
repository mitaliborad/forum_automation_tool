Topic: Hey BHW,

I’m curious about how payment gateway owners successfully market their services, especially to high-risk merchants.

My buddy and I have been exploring the payment space and are really interested in how businesses in this niche reach and build trust with their target audience.

Would love to hear any thoughts or experiences from anyone involved in this space!

Thanks in advance!

Email marketing and ppc. I'm in a regulated market and I always search for payment processors and always tend to find them through ppc ads.

Topic: The fastest and most effective promotion comes through word of mouth. High-quality work is highly valued and spreads quickly. These sectors are usually connected in a single group where life is always active. Providing good services in this group a few times, along with handing out a business card, is enough to make you memorable.
