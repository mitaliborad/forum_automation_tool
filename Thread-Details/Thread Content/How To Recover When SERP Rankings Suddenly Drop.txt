Topic: Recently, I noticed a drop in SERP rankings for some of my target keywords. I started building more backlinks to those specific pages (web 2.0, guest post, etc.). Hopefully, the rankings will recover soon. How about you, what’s your strategy when you face a drop in rankings?

Topic: Without diving deeper into the specifics, it's difficult to provide accurate recommendations. I suggest reviewing your Search Console data and analyzing any new backlinks you've acquired recently. Pay close attention to potentially toxic links, and consider disavowing them if needed. At the same time, work on building fresh, high-quality links to maintain a healthy backlink profile.

Topic: If it’s just a few pages, I’d check internal links first. Seen pages drop just because they lost internal juice after minor structure tweaks. One of mine came back after I added a few links from related posts. Backlinks won’t help much if Google lost the context or crawl path.

Topic: This happened to me before. My site dropped in Google search. I looked for Google updates, fixed some problems on my site like broken links and slow pages, and updated a few old posts. I also added some new, helpful content. After a while, my rankings started to go back up.

Topic: Go to your console and check any penalty.

To get reverse your ranking:
Audit your backlink profile and check lost backlink profiles.
Analyse them on Spam score and then recreate these backlinks.
Make sure do not buil large amount of backlinks.
Do manually check when recreating lost backlink.
