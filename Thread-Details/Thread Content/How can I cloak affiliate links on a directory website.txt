How can I cloak affiliate links on a directory website?

Topic: I built a directory website and now I want to monetize it with affiliate links, but I don't want it to be obvious.

Instead of just adding the link is there some tool (ideally free) that "hide" the links so they don't look like affiliate links.

So instead of the link being something like http://www.affiliateprogram.com/r/ABCD it will just show up as something less obvious?

I would apply this to all the links in the directory to further cloak the links.

No I built the website using Angular so I don't have access to plugins.

What I want to do is just make all the links on the page look uniform.

Like maybe I can use a link shortener on all of them but I wanted to see if there is a better way
