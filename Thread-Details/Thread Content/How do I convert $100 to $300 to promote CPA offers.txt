To be honest, 2 months ago, I learned about YouTube copyright work from some people. Then I bought a channel with 100+ subscribers, and then released some of the latest American TV series and some English action movies. Although the account got some income, the channel was removed soon. In the end, I got nothing.

you have made a mistake here, you should have done:

1. Upload minimum 10 videos
2. Have monetisation
3. Then market your videos using fb, and tiktok ads,
4. In 6 months, you would have touched to millions subscribers.

I just wrote it wrong. I bought a channel with 100K+ subscribers and then posted some of the latest American TV series and some English action movies. Although the account got some income, the channel was removed soon. In the end, I got nothing.
Copyright work videos are very risky

Actually, you made a mistake with 100k+ subs channel, because maybe they were of another niche, and maybe they were bot subscriber, as an expert can you let me know:

1. How many months did you run channel?
2. How many videos had you uploaded?
3. How many views were you getting with those 100k+ subs?
