Topic: I don't trust Google so I want backup AdSense accounts. The thing is I cannot also trust anyone to receive the PIN and enter their data on there.

So is there a way to get extra AdSense accounts to have more channels and not risk shadowbans, viewthrottles etc and not have to trust 3rd parties with this?

That sounds hella dodgy, like you may be buying something flagged or some other thing we are not considering there.

Wait so you are saying you are requesting the verification PIN on the same address and even use the same name and it works?
Sounds like a way to wake up with the accounts banned at a random day.

So we can use real information as payee ? For example if my real name is alex then we suppose to add payee as alex but in adsense account we can use any random name like Bob?

Interesting, i thought that if you used same address and name they would ban you for multi account. Maybe you are more lucky depending on country (im assuming the checkouts depend on country). Im still not sure since I don't want to risk a random ban on my account.

You can try this by creating two new accounts on the same address. Don’t add the same address as your main account, if you’re worried.

I only have one address which is my house. You need to add an address to receive the PIN. The problem is entering the same address would lead to problems or that is the common saying.
