It is against AI content. So blogs which are affected by this update should move to human written content.

A LOT of our clients got their terrible rankings to 1st page with these backlinks.

Google's Helpful Content Update emphasizes creating content that is genuinely helpful to users, not just optimized for search engines. For White Hat SEO, this means focusing more on user intent and providing value through high-quality, informative content. Avoid keyword stuffing and prioritize originality, relevance, and depth in your content. By aligning your strategy with Google's focus on user experience and expertise, your blog will have a better chance of ranking higher and staying compliant with updates.
