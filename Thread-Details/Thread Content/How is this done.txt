Topic: Well somebody made this when i send them the site. And rather quick might i add. So its not a ready made template. I think the person makes some sort of screengrab of the whole webpage.

Honestly, difficult to tell.
This can be done with a desktop app like PS/Gimp or with a script that you is fed a URL an spits out a .png.

It's a template, you should type it with the keyword "website". There are many templates to choose from, however you need to know how to use Photoshop or Illustrator.
