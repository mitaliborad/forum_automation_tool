Topic: I have a compilation horizontal video channel and I posted 11 videos in 1 month, it got 356 views and 35 impressions, it did not receive any traffic without being recommended, I spend serious hours on videos, should I continue or switch to a different channel?

Topic: Hey! So, horizontal videos are actually the standard for most platforms like YT, and they’re not inherently the issue here. The problem might be more about how your content is being discovered and promoted. With 11 videos in a month and only 356 views, it sounds like your channel is still in the early stages, it takes time for YT's algorithm to figure out your audience and start recommending your videos. The fact that you’re only getting 35 impressions suggests that your videos aren’t being pushed out much, which could be due to factors like keywords, thumbnails, titles, or engagement.

Before giving up, try optimizing your content:
Use tools like TubeBuddy or VidIQ to find better keywords and improve your SEO.
Make your thumbnails pop and write catchy titles—this can seriously boost click-through rates.
Engage with your audience by replying to comments and promoting your videos on social media (without spamming).

If you’re still not seeing traction after a few months, it might be worth considering a niche switch or experimenting with vertical/short-form content, especially if you’re open to platforms like YouTube Shorts or TikTok. But honestly, 1 month is way too early to throw in the towel, most channels take months to gain momentum.

Keep grinding, and don’t give up too soon! )

It's normal to have that kind of slow start on a new compilation channel. Continue uploading videos regularly, and one of your videos will eventually get picked up. Your channel will begin to grow fast after you get your first viral video.
