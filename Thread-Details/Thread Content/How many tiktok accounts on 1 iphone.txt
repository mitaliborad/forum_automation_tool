Topic: I have been running a bunch of accounts on 3 android devices, I used to do about 10 accounts per phone, could prolly do more but eh, and they seemed to work fine.

But I think you can't clear the app data on an iphone so how many accounts have yall been *safely* running on a single iphone, i made 3 accounts on an iphone xr that i got, I won't do more on it for now, but what do you guys do?

Unlimited, but you need to set up your iOS xD
For example fresh iclouds, but settings are more

ah, the better question would probably be how many accounts per icloud profile

It's random, sometimes 3, sometimes 8, but soon or later you will face total 0 views without change icloud
