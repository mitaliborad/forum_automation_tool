Hi Trisum,

In addition to Scamalytics, you can use IPQualityScore to check the fraud score of a proxy. A score between 0 and 35 is absolutely fine â€” in our experience, proxies with these scores work normally without any issues.

Topic: Services like IPQualityScore or AbuseIPDB offer blacklist checks for proxies. You could also check out sites like Spamhaus that allow you to search IPs for spam or abuse flags.

You can go to IpHey, Pixelscan or IPFighter to check if your proxy is blacklisted by any websites. Moreover, if you continuously encounter CAPTCHAs and can't solve it, maybe your proxy is blacklisted by this website you are trying to access

Topic: Almost all proxies when checked will be blacklisted by some sites. It is rare to find a proxy that is not blacklisted.

Topic: There are many IP quality check websites, but the most important thing is to look at your specific use rather than just the IP quality. This is meaningless.

Topic: IP quality can be checked on sites like Scammalytics and such, while your general connection can be checked around sites like Pixelscan. Heck, some anti-detection browsers even do that for you prior to actual use. Explore your options, it's a healthy thing to do.

Topic: To check if a proxy is clean:

IP Reputation: Use tools that analyze IP reputation and blacklist status.
Leak Tests: Verify IP, DNS, and WebRTC leaks using online leak-testing tools.
CAPTCHA Tests: Access popular sites like Google or social media platforms. Frequent CAPTCHAs or blocks suggest the IP is flagged.
Behavior Testing: Test the proxy on target platforms to see if it triggers restrictions.
