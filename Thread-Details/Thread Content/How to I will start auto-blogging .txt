Same idea, I just deployed a similar page with WP Automatic Plugin and OpenAI API, you can create completely new content, with images, however some content is duplicated because I haven't gone deep yet on keywords, maybe a long-term strategy would be beneficial.

Topic: So, let me summarize:
1. You need a domain name and hosting to install wordpress, it's relatively easy, google is your friend.
2. A professional looking theme, I often buy from Envato, sometimes on sale for only $19, stable speed, regular updates.
3. WP Automatic plugin also purchased from Codecanyon.
4. OpenAI account, you can use the free version with $5 available but after a while you will be limited to images per minute, so it is best to add a $5 fund to remove this limit.
5. Add the API to your plugin settings, create a keyword list, create a campaign, tweak a few parameters, and you're ready to go.
I can't mention the website here because I'm worried about forum rules.

With only OpenAI text model supported? Is that a joke? OpenAI GPT is not suitable for auto-blogging at all, because of its censorship. You can't use it for auto-blogs in the news niche. Also how you are planning to generated the images without Midjourney? With DALL-E 3? Ha! )

You can start auto blogging by using this plugin:

I uploaded the original plugin for free for you.
