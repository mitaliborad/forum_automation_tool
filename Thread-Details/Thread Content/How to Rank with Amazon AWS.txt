Topic: Does anyone know how this magic ranking is done? Recently, I've seen many Amazon AWS S3 pages ranking for very difficult keywords, including adult content keywords.

For example, if you search the xham*ter keyword on Google in US GEO the site

iheartedu s3 amazonaws com ranks
similarly, Mitolyn, one of the top clickbank products, is ranking through bursa-malaysia s3 amazonaws com

gaming vbucks keyword is ranking through oercommons s3 amazonaws com

I tried track their backlinks, and guess what? None of them have any special backlinks. In the adult content ranking on AWS, it shows hundreds of thousands of backlinks, but they are all low-quality. I don't understand how they could rank for such hard keywords like xham*ter. Does anyone know how to achieve this?
