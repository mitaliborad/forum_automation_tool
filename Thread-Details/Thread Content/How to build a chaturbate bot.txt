How to build a chaturbate bot

Topic: Hello,

I've been trying for a while to code a chaturbate viewers bot in python. I was successful and it was preatty easy with selenium headless to generate ~25-50 anonymous viewers, but this approach is not scalable.

I was trying to reverse engineer/crack the api calls that chaturbate does in order to record a new viewer. Like copying the cURL request from the network console in chrome and reproducing it in postman. It didn't work. Even exporting all the calls that chaturbatte is making when accessing a model page in to a HAR file and then manually executing that file from python didn't work.

They must create some sort of cookie that differentiate each user such that the request cannot be duplicated. I couldn't figure it out. If there's anyone who done this before can you help me with a hint?

It sounds like Chaturbate is using fingerprinting techniques beyond just cookies, possibly WebSockets, unique session tokens, or behavioral tracking. You might need to analyze JavaScript execution to see how they generate those identifiers. Have you tried using a headless browser with a pool of residential proxies and randomized fingerprints (e.g., Puppeteer with stealth mode or Playwright)?

Topic: Have you tried using a bot detection service? That might help you identify and bypass any anti-bot measures that Chaturbate may have in place.
