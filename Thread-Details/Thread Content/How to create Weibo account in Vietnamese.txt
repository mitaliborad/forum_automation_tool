Topic: I managed to create a Weibo account. Doing it on website seemed impossible, so I did it on my phone and use QR code to link it with the website version. But after 1 month, it got logged out. I then had to ask a friend in China to verify my Wechat account to be able to link it with Weibo.

Topic: First, you need a vpn, which can help you bypass access restrictions outside of China. Second, Weibo usually requires a Chinese cell phone number for registration. You may need to find a way to get a Chinese cell phone number, which may require using an online SMS receiving service. Finally, fill in some personal information and you're done.

Topic: You might consider purchasing one, as creating a Weibo account requires a Chinese SIM card. Alternatively, you can look for Chinese SIM card verification services.
