How to create a safe page properly?

Topic: Hello guys. Can you give me a sample safe page? I can't run cloaking because I can't even go through the policy of the safe page. I used VPS for my website and WordPress to build it. I even used Dophin {anty} and proxy for my browser. For the google ads account, I used an agency account with monthly billing. For cloaking, I bought it from this person "LuckyCloaker" and it's working well.

But in the end, I can't run Google ads with cloaking properly.

Can someone help me, please?

Is there a tutorial you can recommend to get started with cloaking as it seems to be the issue to my problem. I need to reach a restricted country via google ads with my Casino gambling ads. However normally they block which is why I need a solution for it. People recommend to do cloaking but I have not understood the entire concept.

yes there is a difference as for SEO you only need to cloak search engine bots.

Topic: OP mentioned Google Ads. So, the safe page will be made for the campaign that will be run in Google Ads and it will be a "cloaked" campaign. In other words, depending on the cloaker, visitors who click the ad would go either to the money page or safe page. Reviewer types of IPs, fingerprints, etc would be shown the safe page.
The safe page must be created in a way that it aligns totally with the Google Ads campaign.
Let us say the keywords in the Google Ads campaign is desks. The landing page must be ONLY about desks AND must have enough of content about desks (atleast ideally 1500 words, add some pictures), do not copy content, make sure it is unique (spin some content, no issues) and for "happiness" of the review algorithms, have contact, privacy policy, terms of service pages.
The above are all the aspects I use to create safe pages.

Topic: The white page doesn't have to be random, it should be a little related to the offer you're promoting!
This mistake is made by many, and it is what makes others special in cloaking!
You have to be very careful in creating the white page, in order to get it looking perfect.

Topic: cross-domain cloaking (where the "safe" page is on one domain and the "money" page is on another) - is it a good practice?
