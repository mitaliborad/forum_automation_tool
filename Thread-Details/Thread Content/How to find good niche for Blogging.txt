that's a great industry because it's both profitable an HUGE, there are lots of touristic places on Earth that are rarely covered (and many more are popping up each day, so the competition is non-existent if you manage to find the locations that are both touristy and not covered by anyone.)

Just pick several of your favorite locations (countries if they are small, otherwise - if you choose big countries like China, USA, Russia, India, etc - pick specific locations like towns, mountain / beach resorts, etc.), find several seed keywords for these locations (like: sightseeings, tours, guide, etc), and then input all of these keywords (one at a time, of course) into Ahrefs / Semrush, and go through the list of keywords to analyze them properly and to find several (5-10) main keywords that you can structure your site around, and then input those 5-10 main keywords into Ahrefs / Semrush to find at least 10-20 long tail keywords that you can target to support your main topics.

Of course, this requires that you have money (to pay for Ahrefs / Semrush), and it also requires that you know what to look for and that you spend time (days if needed) to find that perfect location that no one targets, but that's how you find golden nuggets that no one's willing to share with you otherwise because they're too good to give away.

Also, when you find a few (2-3) such locations for your site(s) you should also find forums or other sites about those locations so you can gather more info from people that have visited them before and which might give you good pros and cons about those locations... you should also check local directories and magazines for specific data that you wouldn't be able to find otherwise (such as tariffs, schedules, locomotion routes and options, etc) to get more actionable information about those locations that absolutely nobody else covers, such as taxi tariffs, museum schedules, things to see / do in that location (parks, restaurants, entertainment, leisure, etc.)

Like I said, spend several days if you must (maybe even a week or two) to gather up and organize all of this information because it's crucial, and once you have this information, along with the right keywords, the right content, the right site structure, and the right domain name ranking will happen easily and automatically as google (sometimes) loves sites that are so helpful towards users

Topic: To start a blog with AI-generated content, choose a niche that has low competition but high demand.
Use Google Trends and keyword research tools like Ahrefs, SEMrush or Ubersuggest to find trending topics with decent search volume.


Focus on monetizable niches like tech, finance, health or education.
You can earn through affiliate marketing, AdSense or selling digital products (e.g., ebooks, courses).


AI works best for how-to guides, product reviews, news and listicles (e.g., “Top 10 AI Tools for Productivity”). Instead of broad topics, go for micro-niches with less competition, such as:


Tech → AI writing tools reviews
Finance → Budgeting for freelancers
Health → Biohacking tips
Education → AI-powered learning

Topic: Find a low competition sub-niche in one of the better paying niches. Passion and everything is alright, but that doesn't pay your bills. Pick a niche that you can write on comfortably after doing some research. Doesn't need to be necessarily a topic that you're already well versed with.

Topic: Greetings, fellow digital nomads and SEO aficionados! Your query regarding AI-driven content creation for travel niches is quite intriguing. Allow me to elucidate on the matter with some advanced methodologies.

First and foremost, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) algorithms in conjunction with semantic analysis can significantly enhance your content ideation process. By implementing a sophisticated latent semantic indexing (LSI) approach, you can uncover hidden correlations between travel-related topics and user intent, thus optimizing your content for both search engines and human readers.

For niche selection, I recommend employing a multi-faceted data mining technique. Utilize web scraping tools to aggregate data from various travel forums, social media platforms, and online booking systems. Then, apply machine learning algorithms, such as k-means clustering or decision trees, to identify emerging travel trends and underserved market segments.

To further refine your niche selection, consider implementing a predictive analytics model that incorporates geospatial data, sentiment analysis from user-generated content, and economic indicators. This holistic approach will enable you to pinpoint high-potential micro-niches within the travel industry.

Once you've identified your target niche, employ advanced keyword research methodologies. Utilize natural language generation (NLG) models to create seed keyword lists, then feed these into sophisticated keyword research tools that leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. This will help you uncover long-tail keywords with high commercial intent and low competition.

For content creation, consider implementing a hybrid approach that combines AI-generated content with human curation. Utilize GPT-3 or similar language models to generate initial drafts, then employ subject matter experts to refine and augment the content with unique insights and local knowledge. This synergy between artificial and human intelligence will result in highly engaging and authoritative content that resonates with your target audience.

To optimize your site structure, implement a dynamic taxonomy system that adapts to user behavior and search trends. Utilize machine learning algorithms to continuously analyze user engagement metrics and adjust your site's information architecture accordingly. This will ensure optimal crawlability and indexability, facilitating efficient knowledge transfer to search engine bots.

Lastly, don't neglect the importance of technical SEO. Implement schema markup to provide search engines with structured data about your travel content. Utilize advanced caching mechanisms and content delivery networks (CDNs) to optimize page load times across various geographical locations. Additionally, consider implementing accelerated mobile pages (AMP) to enhance mobile user experience and improve your chances of appearing in Google's Top Stories carousel.

By amalgamating these cutting-edge techniques, you'll be well-positioned to dominate your chosen travel niche and achieve sustainable organic growth in the highly competitive digital landscape.
