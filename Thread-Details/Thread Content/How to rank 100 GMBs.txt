How to rank 100 GMBs?

Total comments in the thread: 4

Topic: Ok so after seeing success with my 1 GMB profile last year, I decided to attempt making 100 GMB profiles this season for my business and now I finally have them all up!

These 100 profiles cover a 200KM radius (metro city + suburbs).

I’m not looking for advice for every page to dominate my whole city, but rather for each page to just rank enough to cover a small 100k population suburb.

What can I do to 80/20 my results with these 100 pages?

I can basically get unlimited free reviews (capped at 30 per day) spread across these GMBs.

Someone please give me a plan of action

Topic: Damn, 100 GMBs? That’s some serious hustle respect! Targeting smaller suburbs sounds like a smart move, especially if you’re not trying to dominate the whole city. With steady reviews and the right tweaks, you’ll definitely see some solid traction.

Topic: Agreed! Focusing on smaller suburbs is smart. Consistent reviews, local content, and a few citations should help each one rank. Excited to see how it works out!
