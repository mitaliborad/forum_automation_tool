Topic: Hi There,

I am here because I noticed that some of the new EMD domains have a ranking on SERP within two months. I have a few EMD domains but I was unable to rank those keywords.

My domain keywords search volume and competition is low whereas competitors keywords search volume and competition is high. I have implemented on page very well build EAT links or high authority links for my website, still I am not able to rank my EMD domain.

So my question is what strategy they are using to get rank within a two months.

Please guide me

ranking an emd domain in two months is doable but it depends on how aggressive your strategy is most sites doing this fast are stacking low-quality backlinks at scale using spammy blog comments bulk pbn links and parasite seo sometimes cloaking plays a role too the key is rapid indexing plus high velocity link building but if your links are too clean and your content too generic google won’t push your ranking also check if your site is in the same niche as the ranking ones because google treats different industries differently

Thanks for your response,. As per knowledge and experience cloaking websites normally do not sustain for a long term, but some websites are ranking for more than 2 years or 5 years continuously using the same method such as:

1. Publish AI generated content on the website and other PBN network
2. Bulk spammy blog commenting or profile link building
3. forum posting etc.

What tool they are using to build the bulk spammy blogs, forums and profile links? I have noticed that those spammy backlinks are indexed immediately when I check on ahrefs or Ubersuggest but when I build links from those sites then I didn't get backlinks. I do not understand why.

Please guide me.

Hi, Thank you for your response. The competition is about ranking and traffic. Here is the following

1. strong internal linking strategy - No
2. using aged domains with redirects - No
3. building aggressive link velocity - Somehow

They are using like:

1. Publish AI generated content on the website and other PBN network
2. Bulk spammy blog commenting or profile link building
3. forum posting etc.


How is it possible to build links 100 to 200 within 3 hrs? Do they opt in any automatic link building software?

I used Xrumer and GSA SER a long time ago. I received backlinks from heavy spammy websites and after 4 months my website got penalised and once I disavowed them, started improving keywords again...

Here I have noticed some websites that are more than 4 years old and continuously doing the same process as I mentioned but their websites haven't been penalised after multiple times Algo updates. Now those websites are getting 1 to 1.5 million traffic monthly and most of the high volume and competition keywords are ranking in 1 to 5 position. and compete with quality websites and they are using the same backlinks for each website.

So, are there any other tools available that provide the same service?

Topic: Yes, there are was a hole to get EMD to the top within two months. Idk if it's still work after the latest spam updates.

I suppose that they use high quality free backlinks from high DR&traffic websites (rare sources, not trash). Mostly comments, 75-80% DF.
It's not a problem to get such a database. But even if you have a database of such a websites/donors it's not that easy to make the EMD fly, because you have to post 10-20 links daily during 6-8 weeks and have advanced skills to do that (be familiar with syntax for each donor, post masked or invisible links). It's literally a very hard work. Moreover, there is no guarantee that the EMD will take off at all. It's not about random factor, but depends on keyword.

Those guys you mentioned have a team with highly skilled in-house link builders, designers, tech and SEOs and they run teens of EMDs monthly. Part of them are successful, another part abandoned or used to 301 or direct links to the new EMDs.

Ranking an EMD in two months isn’t always easy, even with low competition. Since you’ve nailed on page SEO and built solid links, the key might be something else like content freshness, topical authority, or user engagement. Your competitors could be using a mix of smart internal linking, frequent content updates, or niche trust signals. Have you looked into their backlink strategies, content patterns, or traffic sources
