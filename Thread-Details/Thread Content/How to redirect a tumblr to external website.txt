Topic: You can redirect a Tumblr to an external website by creating a new page on the Tumblr blog, then adding a meta tag with the URL of the external website in the HTML of the page.

Topic: That's a pain, I remember doing that years ago. Did Tumblr change something in their theme editor recently? Maybe there's a new workaround.

Topic: That's a bummer, Tumblr's always changing things up. Have you looked into their redirect option under settings, or is that not cutting it for what you need?
