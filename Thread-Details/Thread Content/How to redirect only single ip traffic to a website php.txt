Hey, you could either do that with a database or storing in json file.

Topic: If you are using a php script rather than an application and you are looking for a quick and easy hack, something along the lines of

PHP:
if($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] === '123.123.123.123'){
    header('Location: https://somenewaddr.com');
    exit();
}

You can filter IPs using server-side scripts (PHP, Node.js) or configure your web server (Apache, Nginx) to redirect based on specific IPs. Just maintain a list of the IPs you want to redirect.
