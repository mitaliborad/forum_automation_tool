Is there a tool/scraper/whatever that can scrape channels with more than X subscribers?

Thanks!

Topic: The question is way too broad.
There is a tool called JavaScript. It can scrape anything.

First of all, scrape from where? YouTube doesn't have a filter to display all channels which have more than x subscribes. So you would need to come up with a way on how to find the links to the channels firsthand.

Secondly, are you looking for a free or a paid tool? Do you want to put in work or you need a ready to go solution?

There are ready made YouTube databases and other scraping tools on BHW marketplace

Topic: idk about any tools and also considering they're gonna be paid most of the time, learn selenium (a python framework (easiest language)) first and make a scrapper which will scrape your desired yt channels from search results.

Topic: There are plugins available that can scrape / import all the Youtube videos that you need into your Wordpress site. Wp Automatic is one of the best tools for this. All you need to do is feed it with relevant keywords and it will just scrape all the relevant videos. You can either publish them straight or save in draft to publish later.
