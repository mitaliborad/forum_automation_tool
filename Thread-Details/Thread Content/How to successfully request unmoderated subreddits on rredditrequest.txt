How to successfully request unmoderated subreddits on r/redditrequest

Total comments in the thread: 14

Topic User: digitalnomadz
Topic: I have a question regarding requesting unmoderated subreddits. How does it really work?

I made a request following the criteria provided (waited for 30 days before making the request) but for some reason my request post was hidden and later my post removed by the Reddit spam filter

I have a good CQS score and my comment karma was enough but I don't understand why my request didn't go through.

What could be the reason why my request didn't go through?

Was I supposed to participate positively in related subreddits or is it that my account has an issue?

Please note that the subreddit I was requesting was a restricted subreddit.

Thanks in advance to everyone that provides guidance.

Topic: Your post getting hidden or removed by the spam filter might be tied to account trust signals, even if you have decent karma and a good CQS. Participating positively in related subreddits can definitely help, as it shows relevance and genuine interest. Also, ensure your account has consistent activity and avoid sudden spikes that might trigger suspicion. For restricted subs, requests might face stricter scrutiny, so try clarifying your intent in detail next time.

Am no expert by any means, however, what I have seen is that you perhaps need to request an invite to a restricted subreddit ...also, unmoderated anything sounds chaotic ~ hope you find the answer

I meant restricted subreddits with no moderation (demodded)

Topic: Before requesting an unmoderated subreddit, make sure you understand what this entails. Unmoderated subreddits are often free-for-all communities with minimal rules. Posts are more likely to go live without moderation or filtering, and the responsibility for maintaining community standards often falls on the users themselves.

Topic: your request may have been removed due to Redditâ€™s spam filter, insufficient activity in related communities, or issues with the clarity of your post. Ensure your account is in good standing, engage positively in similar subreddits, and reach out to r/redditrequest mods for clarification .
