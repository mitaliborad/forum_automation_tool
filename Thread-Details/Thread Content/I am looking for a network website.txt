Topic: If you mean an ad network, ExoClick (https://www.exoclick.com) is a top choice in the adult niche, they’re known for flexible payment thresholds (as low as $20 via some methods), and they fully support banner ads, native ads, and more. Another option is https://www.trafficjunky.com, which specializes in adult traffic and offers banner ad support with competitive rates. Their minimum payout starts around $50, depending on the method, and they’re trusted by many in the industry.

For even lower thresholds, https://www.advertise.com might work, they’ve been around for years and cater to adult sites, though I’d double-check their current policies to ensure they align with your content. In my opinion, ExoClick tends to strike the best balance between low payouts and ad format variety, but always review their terms regarding content restrictions.

Tip: Reach out to their support teams directly before signing up to confirm payout details and banner specs. Some networks also offer faster payments via Paxum or Bitcoin, which can streamline withdrawals. Best of luck growing your site. : )

At HilltopAds, you can monetize any type of website traffic with different types of ads, including banners. Most importantly, you must maintain a high quality of this traffic. Payouts are made every Tuesday starting from just $20.
