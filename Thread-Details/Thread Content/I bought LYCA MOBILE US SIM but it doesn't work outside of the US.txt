Topic: Hello everyone,

I am in Germany and bought from Amazon Lyca Mobile US SIM for creating US TikTok accounts. When I activate SIM I indicated an American address (NewYork zip code). But I didn't use US IP (VPN, Proxy). After register SIM is not catching Germany network (Telekom, Vodafone). Please give me advise how to use US SIM in Germany or may be you have another working method to creating US TikTok accounts outside the US.

Thank you all.

Topic: Lyca Mobile US SIM cards may not have international roaming enabled by default. Try checking if the roaming option is activated via the Lyca Mobile US website or by contacting their support.

US SIM cards often require roaming agreements to work abroad. You need to activate them in the US first or use a roaming-friendly provider.

US mobile proxy don't work well too. It's the same problem. You need a sim card.
