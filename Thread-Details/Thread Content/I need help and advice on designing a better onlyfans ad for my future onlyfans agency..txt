Topic: I've been learning about onlyfans managing and it's been going well, i made an account on instagram, found myself a botting service to make my profile look more legit, and i made a design for an ad but to me it just looks bad.
Im not a really a good graphic designer, i can design a few simple logos, but thats about it. Making ad's, or other types of graphic designs is not my strength. I'll share the design i made below. It's an ai pic but i really have no idea how to make an onlyfans ad for finding models specifically. They never popped out as an ad to me when i was watching videos or scrolling anywhere. Also when i posted this my account got restricted from posting ads on instagram, i read somewhere that you cant say in your ad on instagram anything about onlyfans as ig finds it as a gray area, but i literally have no idea how to make an ad about finding onlyfans models look good or not to mention onlyfans in it, since thats what i am searching for.
