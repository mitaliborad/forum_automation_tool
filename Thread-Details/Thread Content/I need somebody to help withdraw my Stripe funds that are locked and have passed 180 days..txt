Topic: Speaking from experience, the most likely scenario is that they hold on to the money for the legal amount of time they are allowed to (180 days in the US). They might tell you that it'll be released in a month or two but they will most likely extend the deadline every time.

There's really no use in contacting them about it either, they don't care. Say goodbye to the money for 6 months, change payment processors ASAP if you haven't yet...
