Topic: Hi guys,

I would like to share with you my opinion after having tried a lot of panels here with ALL the differents services they sell for Youtube.
Natives views, CTR, Ads targeted, RAV, monetizable, SEO views, Unique Real, HR, discovery, Niche related and many others...

Belive me my video quality /thumb/SEO are very nice. Don't jump on this please

ANY panels provide me a good ranking for my videos and allow me to get suggested, reach home page, get natural reach or anything else.

You can easily imagine I spent a good amount of money though to MAYBE find a good service.
I think there is some service that work but I never found it. So here me 2 cents, don't waste your money. If you want to build autority by just increasing your number of stats it's ok but thats it.

Goole is not fool, he want your subscribers watch a nice percentage of you video, click on notifications and here he will suggest your video.
The best is to have your own private network with google pva account and proxy. Again, maybe there are some services but don't you think I already found it since I'm on this forum ?
Guys continue to maintain the myth so people will continue to spend money and believe they will find something...LOL

Again just my 2 cents, I would like to be wrong believe me
See ya

You can still find non drop views but any can tweak your ranking/natural reach as some years go with HR views. Maybe there is a panel here who sell CTR but its very expensive and I think there is drop + everytime busy server.
I also tried legit Discovery ads from google, its very expensive, you'll get views and impressions but no engagement.
Shorts are just good to bump your sub counts but thats it. You'll get 300k because of shorts, when you'll post a long format : 5k views. Maybe 30 with some chance.
Youtube is a lot of chance today unfortunately. You can produce very good video, there are huge competition in all niches + shit yt algo.

Only blackhat method is a private network or original seller of views. All resellers views are shit.

So, how do you know a reseller?
You just have to keep trying until you find a good service. Like someone said sometime ago here, never give up.

Topic: I tried a lot of them here & did not find EVEN ONE working panel & only wasted my money. All my competitors are buying views & ranking their videos within hours of uploading them & I am unable to find even a single working panel here.

They either never start the order or shows in progress but never deliver any views or they automatically cancel all the orders.

Topic: all panels I tried had an impact on videos

maybe wrong niche / no keywords or ghosted channels and uploading from one ip/identity is one of the problems

Hey Bio-Hazard, is there a single panel you would recommend using for YT views? Need some help finding a good one.

There's no good panel to recommend these days. Their services are not good enough.

No... All the panels sending crap views for me & their reprensentatives/affiliates here on this forum are saying there are lots of panels here which can provide high quality/high retention views, but I tried most of them & all of them are totally BS. They would send 10-20 seconds retention on your videos even after mentioning as High Retention 3-5 minutes etc...

Andif you ask for help here, they will just give you the link to the marketplace section & you will have to beg all the panel reps for test balance, only to find out that the views are crap.

YouTube had made a major update this October, 2023 & none of the panels currently rank any videos.
