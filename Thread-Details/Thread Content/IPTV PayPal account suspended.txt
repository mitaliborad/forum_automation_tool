IPTV PayPal account suspended

Total comments in the thread: 20

Topic User: simorij
Topic: Hello,
I have a paypal account that I use to receive IPTV payments. Today it is suspended and asks me to provide:
Upload a photo ID
Provide proof of fulfillment
Provide proof of purchase from your supplier
Provide more info on your transaction(s)

How do I do this? Should I disguise the fact that it's IPTV, knowing that I have a dispute whose customer has mentioned that it's iptv?

PayPal hates many things, but IPTV is one of the Top five (my personal feeling).

I guess once it's mentioned that you are disputed regarding IPTV, they will freeze your Account. I Can't give you advice, but the User who posted before me already said it correctly.
It's about Risk Management / Spreading the Risk.
I hope you don't have too much Balance on your PP.

Best
zotix.

This can be resolved. I have multiple paypal accounts and this verification appeared after a few sales. This is not critical.

Was it a simple paypal account?
Also you can't do much if the account is on hold....

that's what happen with a new paypal, you should have warmed it up before runing or setup a cloaking plugin to be on safer side.

Topic: Sad to hear this. Have you tried reaching out to their support team? Try to remember or recall if you have violated one of their policies. If an account was suspended, most of the reasons is because the owner violated one of the policies.

Can you please provide short info how to setup cloackin plugin and put the donation links on third party or web page ?
I can't believe how PayPal seize funds from people's accounts. Nobody have right to do that, they dont want to provide refund either. After 10 times calling them they agree to release my funds after 24 days, but if I did not called them the money were frozen for 180 days unbelievable.
