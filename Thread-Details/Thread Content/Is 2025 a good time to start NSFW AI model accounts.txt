Topic: Hi guys,
After a long road of whitehat marketing growth, I'm researching the blackhat fields now, and suddenly seeing NSFW AI content on social platforms is getting crazy traffics.
I've read many threads in this forum about it, but it has been mainly peaking since last year.
But overall, what do you guys think about the competition in 2025? And the next year?

Thanks to all responders. I really appreciate your replies!

Thanks for the advice!!!

Actually, there's some kind of low-quality content (especially in videos), but people still pay for those, and I have absolutely no idea where they get those intentions from...

Topic: The competition will grow from now on. This is the best time to start this. The amount of ai which is coming to social media. I sometime feel, social media will start removing nsfw ai content. Till then, party is on.

I was working mainly in whitehat PPC for normal mobile gaming for about 10 years. But now, I'm trying to go on a new journey.
Blackhat is quite interesting for me in recent years, tbh

Topic: this topic will grow only more. but there is a huge mismatch: there are people who can do content (chat and images) and then people who can do marketing and growth. currently these people rarely connect, so you have shitty content with high visibility and great content that cant get the reach.

Yeah, NSFW AI content has been exploding, and platforms are struggling to keep up. The competition in 2025 will probably get even tougher as more creators jump in, but there’s still room if you find the right angle—unique styles, better engagement tactics, or niche targeting. Monetization might shift too, depending on platform policies. Are you looking into automation or more manual growth strategies?

I think there will be so many creators who are doing it manually.
I'm thinking of automation for several accounts. It should be more worthy of this new journey, and also for the longer term.

Well, i wouldn't use the word pervert. @UnusualSubstance, synonymous to horny, would be more suited.

Would waiting till next year or 2027 when it may already be too late better?

AI model method is still very new, I don't think it's a saturated niche, so 2025 is a good time to start.
