Topic: Hello!

I am quite familiar with JavaScript and I need to learn new programming language for making bots.
Bots for communicators (ICQ, Skype, Trillian and many other). Somebody whop type to me this bot should answer everyone.
And the bots for Facebook (private messages), Pinterest (make follows) and other.

Is C++ a good choice for making these kind of bots?

Topic: Yea C++ can be usefull, but if you don't know too much programming don't do C++ .
C++ is hard language, and you have to know what are you doing.

For bots python is best, it's very easy to learn language, simple to use, lot's of libraries etc.
I don't know any libraries for Skype or ICQ but i bet you will find some.

Python is your best friend here.


What kind of answers they are suppose to be? It's same every time or based on previous message?

Topic: C++ is great if you already have a programming background and dont want to go the lazy way like most hobby programmers to "just get it done the easy way".
with C++ you can create programs that perform way more efficient and faster than stuff made in python or similar, but you have to take care of memory handling and this can cost more debugging time.
i would suggest you start with C# and then move to C++ if you feel like it.

So simple elegant solution must be lazy? What?
So why TensorFlow is made in python...
I like when everybody forget about numpy and say python is slow. (it's slow)

Topic: python is just the first client language, but TensorFlow core is made in C++ as far as i know...
look around almost everything of the more complex and advanced programs you rely on are made in C/C++, your OS, browsers etc and that is for a reason.
python is a language that was made to make things easier, but its also slower and more bloated as you rely on all kinds of libs (offten made in C btw) without doing it yourself and without having to know anything about how things really work. hence why it is prefered by hobby programmers i.e. python + selenium instead of using pure http requests.

c++ is great language , but keep in mind learning curve and coding/testing time is longer than other new languages like c# or python , c++ not for individual coder , companies uses c++ they have team of skilled c++ coders ..., i recommend to use c# will do all of what you mentioned above , python is a choice also .

Yes exactly, everything solid is made is C++
But he just want some auto-reply bot.

and he asked about C++ so i gave my opinion on it. if he wants to start with it, its good, you don't always have to use the easiest solution as its often not the best, thats all i'm saying.
of course if you just want something that works and dont care how its done or if its efficient, then yes some easy language would be fine too.

Topic: I suggest starting with Python.
C++ is overkill for most projects and a pain in the ass to handle.
Python, on the other hand, comes with thousands of libraries, examples etc...

Topic: Do not bother with c++ if you want to create a couple of bots. Don't get me wrong, it is a great language, but there is no need to spend so much longer time to create a bot in c++ when you can do it for couple hours in c# or python if you have some knowledge of programming.
I don't know what your skills are, but c++ is for advanced programmers.
That's why so many languages are in existence - to make our busy lives easier.

Topic: The best language is usually the language that you know. C++ is pretty good. Python, perl works too. If you already know something, use it. You could also try node.js as you said you know js.

Hell no. Take a look at a GET request in C++ vs Python:

C++:
Code:
#include <curl/curl.h>
#include <string>

size_t writeFunction(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, std::string* data) {
    data->append((char*) ptr, size * nmemb);
    return size * nmemb;
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    auto curl = curl_easy_init();
    if (curl) {
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://api.github.com/repos/whoshuu/cpr/contributors?anon=true&key=value");
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_NOPROGRESS, 1L);
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_USERPWD, "user:pass");
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, "curl/7.42.0");
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS, 50L);
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPALIVE, 1L);
        
        std::string response_string;
        std::string header_string;
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION, writeFunction);
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEDATA, &response_string);
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_HEADERDATA, &header_string);
        
        char* url;
        long response_code;
        double elapsed;
        curl_easy_getinfo(curl, CURLINFO_RESPONSE_CODE, &response_code);
        curl_easy_getinfo(curl, CURLINFO_TOTAL_TIME, &elapsed);
        curl_easy_getinfo(curl, CURLINFO_EFFECTIVE_URL, &url);
        
        curl_easy_perform(curl);
        curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
        curl = NULL;
    }
}

Python:

Code:
import requests

if __name__ == '__main__':
    requests.get('https://google.com')

Topic User: Adspect
Topic: No, C++ is not a good language for coding something utility like bots. It is both too complex and too detailed for that. You'll find yourself spending too much time writing boilerplate code, abstractions, etc. instead of actual working logic. As a rule of thumb: do not code utility stuff like bots in compiled languages. Interpreted or JIT-compiled languages like Python, PHP, Lua, and Ruby are the best fit for the task.
