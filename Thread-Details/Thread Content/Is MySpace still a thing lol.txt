History that still exceeds 600,000 unique visitors a month.

Admittedly on a slow but steady downward trajectory.

Actually, it still exists. But I don't know how long it will exist. The accounts on it seem to be no longer used by people because users find Facebook, TikTok,... much more interesting. However, I still see some old people using them to communicate with them. But it seems that young people don't.
