What is SEO after all? Search Engine Optimization

So first we must answer: which Engine?. Are we talking about Google SEO?.

The big question here: are we able to optimize for Google algorithm?

Because I believe we really can't. Google has become a clown fiesta.

I never thought I would say this, but I'm not even using Google for informatinal searches anymore

I'm still using a lot of search engines for different topics including Alphabet owned products (Youtube for videos, Scholar for research papers, Google Maps for local busineses), but I'm not using the Search Engine barely more (unless I can attach like site: like, "smm panel site:blackhatworld.com" or "best open source crm site:reddit.com". I know that many people are still using Google, but we can't still deny that results are going worse and worse every day.

Maybe it's not death but its moribund with a death sentence on top of it. The dawn of Google is near. But not the death of SEO itself. There will always be a Search Engine to optimize for sure. In fact local SEO is starting to be a trend because people is finding that it is actually having more coherence than the Search Engine itself, and it's very useful.

Topic: Google needs to reconsider its actions against small and medium sized businesses. It seems they’re aiming to monopolize the market, which I believe will eventually backfire. Just try searching for something like “Things to do in Dallas” , guess what!!!! most results are outdated Reddit posts from 10 years ago, featuring restaurants and places that might not even exist anymore.....

Topic: Dead? No, if you have very deep pockets it is still alive, but from a business side of things the ROI isn't there anymore and yes it is dying and Google/AI is killing it!

I must say I love all these coping postings...
