They just want you to purchase hosting with their affiliate links and get their share of the dough.

Blogging takes a lot of effort and time to succeed.

Youtube is just for learning the fundamentals. Don't believe in anything else. If any of that was this easy, they'd be making money themselves instead of teaching others.

Topic: It's easy to setup a new WP, create few AI articles and drop them into your fresh new website, but that's not really blogging.
So no, it's not easy, but it's achievable if you learn, do your research and invest time in it.

Topic: Blogging is easy if you are doing it as a hobby without any expectations.

Getting enough quality traffic and earning from that is the hard part.

Anyway, all these youtubers are a big time scam. Just wannabe gurus who are trying to sell the shovels in a gold rush.

Topic: It was much easier before, now it's much harder... it's easier to sell something online instead of just blogging... such as digital product, or even service that later can be automated...

Topic: No, blogging is not as easy as many YouTubers make it seem.

Following challenges, you may face after starting:
- Creating high-quality content
- Building an Audience
- Monetization Challenges
- Competition

===========================

The Reality Behind Successful Bloggers
- Years of experience.
- Expertise in their chosen niche.
- A deep understanding of digital marketing.
- Patience and resilience to overcome setbacks.

So remember Blogging is a marathon, not a sprint.

Topic: Barrier to entry continues to get higher year on year.
Expired/caught domains and working capital can accelerate gains.
If you're trying to do it on a shoe-string budget then focus on micro niches (a niche within a niche) initially.

Topic: Nothing is easy. You can’t trust everyone on Youtube. No one doesn’t want to make money on their own. They won’t leave the real money-making part to you.

Topic: is not that easy, there is a lot of work in the background, if it was that easy they would also be working on bloggin instead of going hard on youtube sharing really good ideas to make money so other people can be rich, don't trust content creators 95% of them a liers and will do anything to bring more people around.

Topic: Not at all! Many YouTubers oversimplify it to make it look glamorous, but blogging requires consistency, quality content, and good SEO strategies to succeed. It’s definitely rewarding, but not as effortless as it seems.
