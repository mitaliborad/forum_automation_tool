Topic: It will depends on the age of your channel, the amount of subscribers, previous videos...if you have a large channel with an active audience, it wouldn't be a good idea

Topic: you need to evaluate, how many videos you have, how many viewers you have, you don't remove the old videos never you keep them but during that change you could lose viewers followers during the transition, sometimes is better to create a new account but if you want to make the change yeah is posible but sometimes is like starting from scratch if niche is totally differemt let's say you are in DIY and move to funny videos totally different and could lost watch time and viewers.
