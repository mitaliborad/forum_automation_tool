Topic: I am wondering if it is good practice for LinkedIn SEO, if I link after a post to a blog post on my homepage/ sales page. Ideally, I would like to post informational content and then link to my homepage as CTA.

Does this practice hurt the performance of the post?
Does someone maybe have resources that answer this?

Topic: You can do both. It will not hurt the performance of the post. As Long as your linkedin post is optimized and fulfill the user intent. Also check if there is another linkedin page is ranking for the same keyword. Google will want to rank one in top 10 you my need to outperform or use a different keyword.

LinkedInâ€™s algorithm prefers native content, posts with links in the front, or links in comments. You might try those with different strategies.
