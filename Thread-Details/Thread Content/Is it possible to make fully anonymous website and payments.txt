You say like Satoshi is a person, in reality, it wouldn't be a surprise if it's CIA, Mossad or any other organization with shady past trying to stay in the shadow. And Satoshi, whoever it is, didn't want to receive payments, a totally different project.

Anyway, there is a huge difference between the Bitcoin creator and those random guys on this forum, some asking about transforming gift cards into monero, others talking about blank checkout offers and this kind of scam, always suspicious to say the least. If you have a legit idea to receive payments, you don't need to care so much about anonymity

Isn't there a possibility that he may just have a strong detest for the taxman?

In any country, a bank account cannot be opened anonymously, but bank accounts belonging to others can be rented with the knowledge of the owner, and they have to pay at least 20%-30% commission to them.

This method is generally used by scammers, the commission rate is almost the same as the tax rate.

I do not think this person will do something with good intentions.

Your assumption or generalisation is absolutely untrue.

Could be but without at least a bit of description or explanation it feels like scam project tbh. Also I'm not sure if it's actually possible to make fully anonymous payments anyway. Qualified enough forensic will still find traces of the people doing it.

Creating a fully anonymous website with payment processing is challenging. But you can use offshore hosting, Monero (XMR) for payments, and privacy-focused services. However, most business bank accounts require verification.

Creating an anonymous website requires a private domain (Njalla, Epik) and an offshore host (Flaunt7). Access everything via Tor or a no-logs VPN.


For payments, accept crypto through BTCPay Server or NOWPayments. For fiat, AdvCash and Payeer offer some anonymity.


Anonymous bank accounts are rare but possible in Belize or Georgia. Another option is using prepaid cards.


Convert money to crypto without KYC via Bisq, HodlHodl, or Paxful.


The key is to avoid any link between your identity and transactions.
