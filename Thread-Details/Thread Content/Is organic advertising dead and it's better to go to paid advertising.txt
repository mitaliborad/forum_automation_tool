Topic: The ideal approach is to combine both for optimal growth. Use paid ads to drive traffic, then convert and retain with organic content.

Both Organic & Paid advertising have advantages & effective but their suitability depends on specific business goals, budget constraints, and desired outcomes..

Yes @CheekyDon , you can magnify the results if you implement both strategies together. While you put out organic content to engage with your audience and build trust, paid ones will help you to boost engagement with a wider audience..

Using both organic and paid ads is better. Organic ads, like posting for free on social media, help grow trust slowly. Paid ads bring fast traffic to your business. In my opinion, mixing them gives you both quick results and long-term success.

Topic: Well, organic can works well if you have strong content, visually and also on what you wrote and created! Many KOLs or writer still success because they have created such great content and sell a good amount of product with their content. But there is a better way is doing paid advertising, reach more people so the success percentage will be higher

Topic: Well in my opinion; Organic advertising isn’t dead - it’s just evolved. While paid ads offer quick visibility, organic strategies build long-term trust, authority, and sustainable traffic. The best results often come from a smart balance of both.
