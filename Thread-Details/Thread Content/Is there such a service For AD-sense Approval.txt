Topic: So, I have AdSense account and would like to purchase domain, Is there a service that can Deal with the posts and approval process of AdSense ?

I have had, websites aproved in the past, but last time it was rejected for a site that I have put too much effort in and I am hesitant in going through the process just to be rejected, So would rather pay for someone else who is updated on the matter, to do that for me

there are services that specialize in getting AdSense approvals, but you have to be careful because many of them use shady methods that could get your account flagged later. If you're looking for a reliable way, try improving your content and optimizing your site structure. Have you checked the latest AdSense approval guidelines?
