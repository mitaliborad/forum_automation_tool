Topic: There are several ways to get clients on WeChat. You can offer a VIP card to your
members through the app, send promotions, and give e-coupons they
can use to exchange in stores. However, the key is to actively engage with
your followers so you can eventually turn them into customers and make
them purchase your items

Topic: WeChat ads can be effective, but ROI depends on your target audience. It's highly recommended for brands seeking to reach Chinese consumers, given WeChat’s vast user base and integration with social commerce. However, the ad system can be expensive, and building a strong ROI requires a well-targeted strategy, compelling content, and sustained engagement. Success often hinges on creating value for users rather than just direct selling. Consider testing different ad formats and tracking performance to measure if it aligns with your goals.

The most important thing is the content of your video and it should be aimed at young people, love, entertainment,...

Topic: Wechat works well for brand building, customer engagement, and long-term loyalty, but it’s not always the best choice for direct-response marketing or quick ROI. Wechat ads, such as Moments Ads and Official Account Ads, can be effective, but they tend to be more expensive compared to platforms like Douyin or Xiaohongshu, which are often better for immediate conversions. If your brand is looking to establish credibility and reach a high-quality audience, Wechat ads can be worth it. The key is having strong content and an optimized funnel, not just running ads blindly.

Another great strategy is leveraging Wechat official accounts and mini programs to create interactive experiences and provide value to your audience. If you’re in e-commerce, having a Wechat store can help with conversions, but keep in mind that payment and logistics integration is crucial. In my opinion, It's fantastic for relationship-based marketing, but if you’re after quick sales, consider testing multiple platforms alongside it.
