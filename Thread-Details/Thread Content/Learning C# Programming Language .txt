Topic: Hey!
C# is a good choice, especially for game dev or web apps. That Naresh IT course looks solid, but I'd recommend checking out reviews first to make sure it's the right fit for you. Either way, start with small projects to get hands-on experience. C# is pretty nice once you get it. Howâ€™s it going so far?
