Topic: Coming up with a name is always a big problem, either you can’t come up with a beautiful one, or the domains are busy. You can try namelix to get some inspiration or a ready-made name.

Topic: Choosing a company name is important. You can try combining tech-related words like "InnoTech," "ByteWave," "CodeNest," or using your initials with "Solutions" or "Systems." Think about your company's vision—do you focus on AI, software, or cloud solutions? You can also use AI tools like Namelix or Looka for unique suggestions. Keep it short, easy to remember, and relevant to your industry.

Hope this will help you

Thanks
