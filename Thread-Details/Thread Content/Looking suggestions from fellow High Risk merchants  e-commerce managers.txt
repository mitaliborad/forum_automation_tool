Looking suggestions from fellow High Risk merchants / e-commerce managers

Topic: Hello mates,

I own multiple high-risk e-commerce stores, including white-label, reselling, and dropshipping businesses in various categories such as IPTV, Vape, social media marketing, digital subscriptions, and more. I've built these over the past 8 years, and some are doing really well. However, I believe there’s still significant room for growth.

A few points I’ve encountered:

SEO Challenges: While I’ve secured backlinks from various sources, many have high toxicity scores, resulting in wasted investments.
Payment Gateway Issues: I’ve been struggling to find the right solution. Recently, I found Card2crypto, which works well for WooCommerce stores but has a low conversion rate for my targeted region.
I’m looking for:

New SEO techniques to improve my site’s performance that are still unknown to most
Alternative payment gateways that support card payments with crypto settlements
Suggestions for new niches to enter or profitable opportunities for white-labeling something .
your answer can be helpful to other fellow members also, Thank you

Can you explain more details about why conversion rate is low for card2crypto ?
And does it supports all countries ?

Cuz people wanna pay with card easily. These gateways who take payment in card and payout in crypto ask customers to kyc which is super unfriendly for customers. Like imagine needing to send a pic of ur passport and a selfie to buy iptv

they require mini KYC, some providers are friendly like some ask only for phone verification or email verification. but in UK some ask for id verification. it supports all countries but checkout is different for every region. but as settlement are instant i am still using it for international payments

yes, there is no kyc from merchants as its decentralised platform but customer has to verify email or phone and in some case even more. but as a high risk merchant I am using it for international payment. conversion is low but I am using multiple providers at a same time.
