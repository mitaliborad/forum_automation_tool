Looking to buy aged LinkedIn accounts (not for scraping)

Topic: I have tried purchasing fresh LinkedIn accounts and they keep getting restricted. I use an anti-detection browser and proxy. Also, I'm cautious in my connections and have waited on most of them. However, they keep getting restricted.

Please message me if you have accounts that are aged appropriately and you can provide clear instructions of how to access them without triggering restrictions.

I learned that quickly. However, I just bought an aged account that was a few years old and has 80 or so connections. I was incredibly careful. Used a mobile IP from a major carrier in the area where the account said it was from. Also, I didn't change anything with the account (name, email, location, password, etc.). I didn't try to connect with anyone. I made sure to open any emails from LinkedIn and followed the verification steps. After about two days I was logged out and after following the verification steps, it's forcing me to verify the identity.
