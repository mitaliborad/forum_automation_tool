Low reach & poor engagement on WeChat lives?

Total comments in the thread: 17

Topic: I work with an OnlyFans model, and her engagement on TikTok lives is great, consistently hitting 5k views throughout the live, however on WeChat the engagement is terrible rarely hitting 100+ views with poor conversion, does it pick up the more you use it? Can anyone direct me to information that would be useful to read? I don’t feel that she is the issue or her content, and it would be great to utilise another platform for growth,

Thanks for reading!

WeChat is primarily used in China and is more focused on personal connections and messaging, rather than content sharing or live streaming like TikTok.
Kinda true. Live-streaming is 10x a thing in China than it is in the west. There’s also many other platforms including ‘little red book’ (similar to Instagram) that female influencers use that you can tap into to.

Damn bro sorry to hear. I don’t get why someone who is ‘making money’ would scam someone for $20.

he is not longer active in the forum so i guess that's good enough.

Topic: that's because the different platforms have its own use.
wechat is just like messenger combined with ins that people can share their daily life to others, also aim to share to their friends, notice, is a combination about message and pics not videos
but for tiktok, it focus on videos and you can choose your video to be open and show to everyone
different platforms have their strengths, you should figure it out

Topic: WeChat's a whole different beast than TikTok; maybe try tailoring the content specifically for that platform’s audience, like behind-the-scenes stuff or Q\&As. Have you checked if WeChat has specific content guidelines that might be affecting visibility?
