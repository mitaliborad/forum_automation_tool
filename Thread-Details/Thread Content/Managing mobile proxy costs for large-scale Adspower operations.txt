Managing mobile proxy costs for large-scale Adspower operations

Total comments in the thread: 7

Topic User: kimjensen
Topic: I'm trying to figure out how to keep mobile proxy costs manageable when running hundreds of 'aged' Adspower profiles across several team members.

The challenge I'm facing is that we need to perform many small-value actions, each requiring proxy use, but the typical costs of mobile proxies ($30-50 each/month or high pay-per-GB rates) make this hard to scale economically.

Has anyone found effective solutions for:
- More affordable mobile proxy providers for this type of use case?
- Strategies for proxy rotation or sharing to reduce total number needed?
- Ways to minimize data usage without compromising stealth performance?
- Alternative approaches for large-scale operations?

Any insights from those who've tackled similar scaling issues would be greatly appreciated!

(Please don't send me the proxy marketplace, as it will not help in this case)

A mix between these two may be the winning path.

- Strategies for proxy rotation to reduce total number needed?
Rotating proxies - If the mobile proxy can rotate the IPs at a 5 minutes interval, you will have 12 IPs/h or 288 IPs/day or 8640 IPs/30 days. You can set the proxy to autorotate at 5 minutes, or (better) you can manually rotate de IP every time you need. If you correctly split the rotating time according to your needs, you will cut a lot of the needed proxy devices.

See this thread to get some ideas: reduce proxy bandwidth usage

Thank you for taking the time to reply.
I understand we can do some rotation, but imagine there are 10 workers managing several hundred profiles, and we have 5 mobile proxies in the US. How can such rotation work without everyone causing issues for each other? I understand we could buy 10 proxies, but since we need other countries as well, it adds up and gets too expensive.

You can link all these proxies to single server and create either "virtual network" a local host proxy act as repeater to one of proxies you have, inside these proxies/virtual network you can blacklist or redirect URLs that consumes most of bandwidth, large images large .js files ..etc
I tired this once with a free Ipv6-ipv4 tunnel service and I created over 1000 ipv6 proxies from multiple locations for free.

I haven't been able to find good pay-as-you-go mobile proxy pools with affordable per GB rates, if you know any please share it in private.

Topic: Have you also tried taking advantage of bulk purchase discounts from proxy providers? Many providers offer significant savings when you buy in larger quantities, which can drastically reduce your overall proxy costs.
