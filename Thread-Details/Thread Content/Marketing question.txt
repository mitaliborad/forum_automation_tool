Topic: Hey people of BHW!
I know that out there we have a lot of experienced people regarding marketing so i wanted to ask this question.
Lets say i have a product site and everything else ready execpt marketing (ads) and have only 15$ budget left more or less.
Is it better to do ads free campaing on social media at that point or would you recomend me an ad provider that would more or less contribute to at least 4% CTR and 2% Conversion rate of lets say 100 clicks ?

Topic: I wouldn't exactly call 15 bucks a budget.

Usually, marketing is the biggest and on-going expense any business has. Sky is the limit really.

I would look into free methods in your case yeah.

Do not water time with $15. You need thousands of dollars just to find out an working ad. You will be wasting time creating site and maintaining it if you have just got $15 with you.

Topic: I agree with others. For testing alone, you need at least $500-$1000, and then you will need quite a bit of money to scale things

Topic: Hey! With a $15 budget, I recommend focusing on free social media campaigns. Paid ads might not provide enough clicks or conversions with that amount. Leverage organic strategies to maximize reach before investing in paid ads later.

Topic: You can consider platforms like Bing Ads or lesser-known networks like PropellerAds for cheaper clicks. Achieving a 4% CTR and 2% conversion on a small budget is challenging but possible with tight targeting.

Topic: I recommend starting with organic social media efforts since you cannot do anything with $15, essentially. Use platforms like Instagram or TikTok to build relationships and grow from there.

Topic: Since you have almost no money, only free methods are an alternative to you . You should explore new social media apps to drive traffic. Popular ones like FB are already very crowded.

You need to advertise, you will reach more people, it will help you earn more than your budget.

Topic: With $15, you can use 30 different accounts to manage your product website as well as assist you with marketing. You can use anti-detection browsers to run marketing automatically. It is a good solution that helps you save time and effort, allowing you to automate interactions on the platforms you want.

15$ budgetvis nothing. Your focus should be on increasing that budget first. If you are not able to increase the budget, you should try some other work like freelance jobs.

Also there is something like minimum amount required. Like less than $1000, one should not bother at all.

Is $15 budget hypothetical or that is all you have ? Making any return with this much budget is very hard. You need to be a genius to make anything substantial out of it.

That budget is like nothing. You need to increase it even to try ads.

Topic: If I were you, I would just put that 15 bucks back in my pocket and just hit Reddit.

Seriously!

Analyze your product and look for the problems that it solves.

Then go on Reddit, and look for the communities where those problems are being discussed.

A shortcut to this is to find the names of your competing products, put them on Reddit, and see what they're doing.

I wouldn't blindly copy what they are doing because a lot of them are probably spammy, but you get the point.

You need to get into the conversation and then talk about your brand and slowly become an expert because you're sharing actionable solutions with people.

I know this is not sexy because it takes a while, but it's actually quite productive.

The more you know about your niche and the more valuable the content you share on social media becomes, the more credible your brand becomes.

It's definitely worth doing because you are building a brand over time.
