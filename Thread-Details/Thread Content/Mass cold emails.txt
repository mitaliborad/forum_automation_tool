Topic: Buying a domain still needs a sender. So, use Gmail accounts, which can send 50 to 500 emails based on Gmail account type.

Topic: For 10K, start with Gmail Workspace ($60-180/mo for 10 accounts) + 5 domains for flexibility. It's cheap, fast, and will reach your goals. For 100K, domains are king - 700 domains + SMTP is what the pros do (think @scaling_shields
“400 accounts, 10K, scale up”). Gmail alone can't handle that burden - too many bans, too few controls. Budget $10K-15K upfront for 100K (domains, proxies, tools), then run $5K-7K/mo.

Like age, business type, student, etc., True, because email spam has increased based on spam filters sending emails mostly to SPAM, but not always. Optimize your template and use good links. You will see better results over time.

> Residential Proxy Rotation
> Spintax
> Dont sent more than 50 emails per day from each account

Small, minor tweaks will improve your inbox over time.

Good luck

You're not too familiar with mass emailing I suppose.

Gmail is perfect for mass amounts. We create setups that send 5k, 10k, 20k daily using gmail accs. You just have to know how to do it.
by the way, I use this tool for mass emailing: https://gmonster.co

Lmk how it works for you.

Topic: Gmail isn’t built for mass cold emails - you’ll get flagged fast. You need multiple warmed-up domains with proper SPF, DKIM, and DMARC setup. Use email automation tools like Instantly, Lemlist, or Gmass. Rotate IPs, use spintax, and throttle sending to stay under the radar.

Scaling to 100K/day takes a solid infrastructure. I was using n8n workflows for this purpose, works well if you know how to use them.

Good luck!

No difference regarding inboxing capabilities. Workspace business accounts might have the slight benefit of having the custom domain in the address, therefore b2b could take you more seriously. That said, regular Gmail works for that purpose as well.

- Gmails use Google's own smtp servers. They all have the correct setups you mentioned.
- Instantly uses the same exact AWS vps and static IP for all your accounts.
- Gmass is browser based, therefore also uses Google static ip and smtp servers.

100k/day does need a solid infra though. It can be done with Gmail, Workspace even Outlook.. whatever you want.

Topic: You can achieve sending 100k using Gmail accounts and proxies.

You'll need an automation that rotates accounts and proxies, send with delays and spintax.

Sending bulk sms has similar spam issues too.

Topic User: tal2151
Topic: Hi, happy to help

We send over 100k cold emails per day.

What we do is we buy multiple domains, and setup 4 inboxes per each domain.

Each cold email accounts sends 25 cold emails per day per inbox (after a 2 week warm-up)

We use Instantly.ai to send the cold emails.

we manage over 5,000 google workspace inboxes ourselves (and we set up thousands more for our clients)

We have this at a reseller price at 2-3 USD/mo intstead of the full $7.2/mo per inbox.

Attached is one of our Instantly workspaces.

Topic: Find someone who can set you up on a self-hosted Email Marketing Software with your own SMTP server. You can send whatever amount for a fixed price a month no need to deal with bans or burning accounts or whatever.

Your main task will be to maintain the reputation of your IP based on delivery rates, bounces etc which will be a function of the quality of your email lists, the emails that you send etc.


If you want want to increase the sending rate you simply buy more capacity from the provider.
