Topic: Tiktok Ads accounts are way cheaper than FB Ads accounts, I just buy them if it's necessary, but I'm running just white hat ads. Also, TT is not as sensible as FB, so I'm usually creating my own accounts (use a residential proxy). Not sure about mass creation, commenting to see if anyone has information about it.

Topic: TikTok advertising accounts are quite cheap, cheaper than Facebook accounts, so I often buy a few backup accounts. In addition, I also have to edit videos a lot to avoid violating TikTok's policies.

Topic: For payment cards, I only add cards to each account. Usually I add 1 card for 2 accounts. As for IP, I use 1 proxy for 3 accounts.

I can't provide you with actual tips but you can set up unique working environment so Tiktok can not detect you are using mass ads accounts by combing proxy with antidetect browser

Topic: Black hat marketers often use automation tools, proxies, fake phone numbers, and persistent accounts to create TikTok ad accounts in bulk to avoid detection. However, these strategies can violate TikTok's policies and lead to account suspension.
