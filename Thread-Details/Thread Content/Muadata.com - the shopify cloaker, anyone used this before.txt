Topic: I have used the PayPal cloak, Stripe cloak, and Square cloak provided by muadata, and I think they're quite good. I have been selling replica shoes and have always used muadata and moyidata's cloaks. I feel like these two companies might be the same. However, these details aren't that important; the most important thing is not getting your payment account banned. If you're interested, I recommend using muadata because they offer a monthly payment option.
