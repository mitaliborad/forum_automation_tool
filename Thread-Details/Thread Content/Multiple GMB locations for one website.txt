Multiple GMB locations for one website?

Topic User: SEOzack
Topic: Ok, you GMB guys and gals.

I have a question.

For a new site, I have created, I want to create some GMBs to push the authority and build leads.

I want a GMB for every major city in the UK.

Ideally three of four.

The question is, can four different GMBs be created and linked to the same website?

I *think* I would prefer to do that than have one single GMB.

Thoughts?

Topic: I don't see anything wrong with having different GMB linked to the same website as many big enterprises do.

Just use some common sense: use different emails, IPs, do not create them all at once, etc

That was my thinking, tbh.

Maybe worth a try anyway.

Topic: Sure, it's pretty easy to do. You can even import them from an excel if you're a large business. I manage two businesses where one has 40 linked GMBs to a site (service area, no address), and the other has roughly 100 (all have physical addresses). If you have 10+, you can do bulk verification.

Topic: It works but there will be increased risk of getting all listings if one gets banned. Not all the time, but it is for sure a footprint.

Isn't it easier to list the one GMB account as having multiple locations?
I know you have to know someone at the other addresses to be able to verify.
But I think this way it'll be easier to promote one gmb rather than many?

You mean the service area listings? or create multiple GMB's?
