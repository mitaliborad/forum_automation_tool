Multiple TikTok Accs on a Single Phone?

Total comments in the thread: 20

Topic User: CompletelyCracked
Topic: I am planning to run multiple TikTok accounts from my burner phones with residential proxies.

Can I run 2-3 TikTok accounts per phone? Or should I stick to 1 account per phone?

I guess it looks "more human" to have 1 account per phone, no?

Thanks! Can you share more details on that?

1. Do all 3 accounts sit on the same proxy? Or you change your proxies once you log into a different account?
2. Did you warm up those 3 accounts yourself on the same phone? Or you bought the accounts?

If you want to run only 3 accounts, do not make proxies or other crap.
TikTok allow for that

TikTok is not proxy based, it's sim based

Okay. Lol. Thanks. So I suppose simply buying a T-Mobile USA phone number from Amazon with no data plan should work? I was told by some other TikTok gurus that I need to have proxies. That sim cards alone won't do it.

It will, but it's limited to 2-3 accs. To do it for 20+ accs, you need manipulate sim.

1. I use VPN. Same US IP for all accounts in 1 phone.
2. I warm up on the same phone.
TikTok allows multiple accounts on one phone, so there's nothing wrong to do it. No need to worry.

Topic: It is safer to have one account per phone to avoid TikTok detection. This looks more natural and reduces the risk of bans. If you want to manage multiple accounts on one phone, use cloning apps and well-configured proxies, but itâ€™s riskier.
