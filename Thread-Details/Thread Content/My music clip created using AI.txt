I paid $10 for Suno AI and $15 for Kaiber AI - these are monthly subscriptions. In Suno AI I made 15 songs, of which I like and can use, probably 7 or 8. In Kaiber AI I made 3 videos and am making 3 or 4 more, 2-3 minutes long.

How many songs and clips do you think you can make from these subscriptions? Let's say that for one good music video clip you need to do it three times to make one good one.
