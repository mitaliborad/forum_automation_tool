Topic: Hi guys!

I have a WordPress adult site built with WP script. I have the PHP version at 7.2 and I should bring it to at least 7.4 but when I switch to the new ones my site goes down with the classic “ 404 error page not found” .
I don’t know if is a problem with some plugin or the Retrotube theme that I’m using.
I hope anyone can help me

Topic: first thing i do before i google everything is rename my plugins folder, as most of the time i have found the issue is a plugin, and if you rename the folder & test again,
you can quickly tick that off your list before you tackle anything else.
The best WP themes I have ever used are with Themify. They have a great range and are all secure, updated, and affordable

Topic: It’s likely your theme or plugins are incompatible with PHP 7.4. Start by updating all plugins and your Retrotube theme. If the issue persists, disable plugins one by one to identify the cause, or check error logs for specific details.
