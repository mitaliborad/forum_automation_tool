Thank you so much for letting me know. I am a bit searching for new channels and just wanted to make sure Myspace is out of the picture.

@Pouya Eti

Myspace was one of the popular social networking websites back in 2005. Despite being infamous these days, it's not considered dead. Using this social networking site as a marketing tool is possible if you're promoting your music. Bands and musicians still utilize this site to showcase their talents. Moreover, they also use this to connect with their fans.

Topic: MySpace marketing involves leveraging the platform's customizable profiles, music integration, and community features to build brand awareness, connect with target audiences, and promote products or services creatively.

MySpace is largely inactive as a social platform, with minimal user engagement or feedback compared to its peak years.
