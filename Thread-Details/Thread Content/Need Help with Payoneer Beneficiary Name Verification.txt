Need Help with Payoneer Beneficiary Name Verification

Topic: Hey everyone, I’m running into an issue with Payoneer and could really use some advice. I manage multiple accounts on a marketplace, under different names and receive payments through Payoneer. Recently, they flagged a payment because the beneficiary name didn’t match the name on my Payoneer account. Now, they’re asking me to clarify the beneficiary name and provide verification documents.

Here’s the message from Payoneer:
The beneficiary name on this payment does not match the beneficiary name listed on your Payoneer receiving account. To add this beneficiary name to your receiving account, please classify the beneficiary name and provide the requested info.

The options they’ve given me are:
Store name: Provide a screenshot of my marketplace account profile, an invoice, or proof of order/delivery.
Name of a company that you represent: Submit a letter from the company authorizing me to receive funds on their behalf.
Western name: Not applicable in my case.
I’ve been dealing with this issue for a while now and always ended up paying someone to create a fake invoice, website screenshot, or sales history just to get it resolved. It’s becoming a hassle, and I’d really love to learn how to do it myself.

Does anyone know an easy way to create a convincing invoice or have a template I can edit? Any guidance would be greatly appreciated!

Yeah, I’ve tried reaching out to Payoneer support multiple times, but they always ask for documents that I just can’t provide. Does a Payoneer business account require beneficiary verification, or is it more flexible in that regard?
