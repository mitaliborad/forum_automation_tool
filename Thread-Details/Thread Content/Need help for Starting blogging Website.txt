Topic: I’m starting a gaming news and reviews website like GameRant. I already bought the domain, and since I’m a web developer, I’ll build it myself. I can work on this full-time, so I’m ready to put in the effort.

I have a few questions:

Time Commitment: How many hours per day/week should I dedicate to this project for steady growth?
Content Frequency: How many articles should I aim to publish daily/weekly/monthly to gain traction?
SEO & Ranking: If I consistently publish articles, how long might it take to see decent page rankings?
SEO Tips: Any proven strategies to boost organic traffic for a new gaming site?
Thanks in advance for your help! Excited to hear your insights.

My team has six people working on content publishing. If we need to put out at least 20 SEO-friendly articles every day (covering trending stuff like the Silksong hype or news similar to IGN/Game Rant), how much time do you think that’ll take? Any tips?

Topic: If you are using AI tools then I dont think it will take that much time. Regarding how much time it takes to get rankings, as we dont know your keywords or backlink strategy,noone can comment on time frame.
But, i will add my perspective. Stick to your game plan for 6 months and you should start seeing decent results.
1) 2 hours
2)1 per day minimum
3) 3- 6 months (medium level keywords)

Good luck

24/7

If you take breaks google might release an update that can screw your site. If google doesn't screw your site, your competitors will outrank you.

SEO is a non-stop process, it doesn't end after you build the site, you need to constantly....

- publish content
- build links
- promote the site in other ways (social media, YT, forums, UGC sites, etc)
- track, monitor, analyze everything that's going on with your: rankings, pages, backlinks, keywords, traffic
- stay up-to-date by following the latest SEO news and discoveries by reading up on forum topics, watching YT clips, running A/B or SEO tests, etc

1 article a day should be enough in the beginning. If you target the right keywords and don't get sandboxed for 6-9 months (the usual sandbox period) you're going to "gain traction" within weeks...

Although, since you're having a gaming website, I think mixing it up with YT both ways (drive traffic from YT to your site, and from your blog posts to your YT vids) is a much better approach than publishing boring walls of text that (most likely) the gamers will never read.

I am a gamer myself, and I also watch tons of YT clips on various games, and I can tell you from first-hand experience (both as a gamer and as an ex-site owner) that when it comes to gaming, I will choose watching YT clips over reading blog posts 90% of the time

SEO & Ranking: If I consistently publish articles, how long might it take to see decent page rankings?
this question has no answer, because....

1) each niche, each site, and each keyword is treated almost differently, so it depends on all of these, and it also depends on your competition

2) there is a thing in SEO that's called sandbox, and it happens quite often (especially for fresh domains), and if you get sandboxed you might not rank for anywhere from 3 months all the way up to 2 years (although, 2 years is a long time, I've not seen any site being sandboxed for so long lately... so, if you're getting sandboxed it's possible that you won't see a single click and visitor for 3-9 months no matter what you try)

3) we don't know what "decent rankings" means for you. For some people, decent rankings is top 10, for others it's top 3, etc... Also, just because you might rank top 3 it doesn't mean that your traffic will be good, high, or both (google does regulate the traffic and sometimes they send more and better traffic to pages / sites they like even if those pages / sites rank #9 or #10, while #1 ranked sites might get nothing. It doesn't happen all the time... or even frequently, but it does happen, so "decent rankings" doesn't mean anything anymore. Just focus on increasing your ranked pages and keywords gradually over years, and getting as much highly converting traffic - with or without google - as you can, and eventually you will get where you want to be... unless you're competing with big gaming sites, if you target keywords that those sites are ranking for and if google favors those sites... well... I don't see you ranking over them anytime soon

I've never owned gaming sites, so I wouldn't know what to say besides what I said earlier: mix your blogging site with YT clips. You said you have a team of 6 people creating content, that's more than enough to be able to crank out at least 2-3 YT clips and 4-5 articles per week for at least 6-7 months until - I predict - you will manage to establish a constant flow of traffic.

But other than this, I don't know what else to recommend.... maybe the usual and boring ( ) SEO tips like keep publishing content, keep building quality links (few of them per week initially, but consistently), get your technical and on-page SEO right. have good CWV and speed scores, mobile friendliness, etc...

I totally get this, I’m a gamer too, and honestly, I watch YT clips way more than reading blogs. But you ever notice how big leaks or official news always hit blogs/sites first I check Google Discover daily for gaming news, and it’s always packed with useful updates. Meanwhile, YT takes 1-2 days to catch up… and by then, it’s just reaction vids and clickbait

Topic: You can create a repository of articles. To ensure that the articles are published regularly. There are many other SEO factors. But let's start by analyzing the search traffic of the keyword. Choose keywords with searches >500 / 1 month and difficulty at an easy level. Write articles containing those keywords first. You can filter content from the first 3 results and use that to write your own content. If you intend to use AI to write articles, you need to make sure that you have checked the content for duplication and avoid errors written by AI. That's just the beginning. There are many other SEO techniques. You can backlink. Promote your website.

Topic: yo man, props for going all in. if you're serious, try to put in like 6 hrs a day minimum. for content, even 1 solid article daily can move the needle.

Rankings won't be instant—give it like 3–5 months if you stay consistent. from my end, long-tail keywords and posting fast on trending games helped a lot. also, don’t ignore internal links—makes a big difference over time.

Topic: You’re definitely off to a strong start. Being a developer and going full-time gives you a real edge. In terms of time commitment, putting in around 4 to 6 focused hours a day should give you steady progress, especially during the first few months. For content, aim for consistency rather than quantity. Publishing 3 to 5 solid articles per week combining news with evergreen reviews or guides can help you gain traction. As for SEO, with regular publishing and proper optimization, you can expect to see decent rankings within 3 to 6 months, depending on the competition in your niche. It's a good idea to focus on long-tail keywords early on, build strong internal links between posts, and share your content in relevant subreddits or gaming forums to attract initial traffic. Additionally, start building an email list from the beginning; it can become a powerful asset later on. The gaming niche is competitive, but by going deep into a specific sub-niche or platform, there’s still plenty of room to stand out and grow.
