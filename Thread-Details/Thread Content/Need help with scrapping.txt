then you are asking us to help you solve an equation with 3 unknowns, and you are giving half the data of one of them, it is difficult to advise here

universal solution step by step:
1. find source/website with desired data
2. code/build scraper to scrape this
3. save it into database and then deliver to clients
done

Lesson 1: It’s scraping, not scrapping. Scraping and scrapping aren’t the same thing.

As for tools, my tool of choice is node.js + puppeteer. But it might actually be possible to scrape the data just using http requests. In that case use a fetch client like axios and something like cheerios to get the data easily. That should do it much quicker. It depends on the site you are trying to scrape.

Did you try scrapingrocket?

It does all of what you suggested without any coding.

It has a Visual Selector page that displays the scraped web page within an iframe.

You simply need to click on the elements you want to extract from the web page.

This action will generate a Cheerio config file, which you can then use on other similar URLs to extract data in JSON format.

No, I haven’t. But this sounds pretty interesting. I will give it a try if a project like that comes up in future.
