Topic: Does anyone know someone who can creat 100+ names, addresses, emails, and phone numbers(fake of course) to help my client, a chiropractor clinic, win a “Top Pick in our Area award”? 100 votes should do it, they need to have a real local address and ideally IP address coming from the area. Open to suggestions!! Thanks

Topic: Can you tell me more about what you'd do with Top pick of your area award? Would you later use it in SEO? As part of a pitching process? Outreach?
