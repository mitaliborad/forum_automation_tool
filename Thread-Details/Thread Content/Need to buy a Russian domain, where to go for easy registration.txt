Do you know how long it takes before the domain is visible in Europe? ordered yesterday and still nothing shows up!

You can register domains with non-European and non-US registrars. Here are a few reputable options:


Porkbun (based in Seychelles) – porkbun.com
Dynadot (HQ in China for their global branch) – dynadot.com
NameSilo (alternative divisions outside US) – namesilo.com
Internet.bs (Bahamas-based) – internet.bs
Hostinger (Lithuania but not US/EU-centric) – hostinger.com
Netim (France-based but allows offshore domain privacy) – netim.com

Topic: If you're looking to buy a Russian domain (like .ru or .рф), some popular and easy-to-use registrars include:


Reg.ru – One of the biggest and most trusted in Russia.
Nic.ru – Official Russian domain registrar, good for all .ru-related extensions.
101domain.com – International-friendly option that supports Russian domains.
Namecheap – Limited support for .ru, but good for other related TLDs.


Pro Tip: Some registrars may ask for passport info or business registration if you're outside Russia — Reg.ru tends to be the easiest for foreigners.
