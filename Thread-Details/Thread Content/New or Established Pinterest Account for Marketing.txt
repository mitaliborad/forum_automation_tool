Topic: I’m starting with Pinterest marketing and wondering if it’s better to create a new account or buy an established one with followers.

Also, are there any trusted websites to buy Pinterest accounts?

Would love to hear your thoughts!

Thanks!

Topic: A new Pinterest account will have a fresh start with no existing pins or followers,

while an old Established account has a history of saved pins, boards, and potentially a built-up following,

if you want to focus on a completely different niche or brand identity; depending on your goals, starting a new account can allow for a more focused strategy from the beginning..

So, New or Established Pinterest Account for Marketing based on your goals.

But, When it comes to Pinterest marketing, a new account generally offers a fresh start with the potential for faster growth and better search ranking compared to an old account, which might have established engagement but could be hindered by outdated content or algorithms that favor newer profiles, making it often recommended to create a separate, dedicated new account for marketing new products or services.
