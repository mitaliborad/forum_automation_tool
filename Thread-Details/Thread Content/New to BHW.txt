Topic: Hey BHW community!

I am a freelance Link Builder. I’m currently diving deep into SEO, specifically link building and Digital PR. I’m learning the ropes but also exploring ways to turn it into a profitable skill.
What brought me here? Deepseek told me about this, and after reading a few threads, I knew this was the place to grow.

I’m here to learn from people actually doing the work, not just theory. I want to sharpen my skills, contribute when I can, and hopefully connect with others doing white-hat, grey-hat, or creative link building work.


If you’re in the link game or doing cool stuff with content and outreach, I’d love to hear from you.


See you around the forum!
