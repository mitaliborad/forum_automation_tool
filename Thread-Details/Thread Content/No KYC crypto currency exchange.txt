I got one question: Is there a well known actual NO KYC crypto currency exchange service out there, where I can exchange for example BTC to LTC or any other crypto?

Topic: Mexc is a centralized one currently. But I feel like all centralized exchanges will require KYC some day.

Decentralized I would use a combination of Exodus wallet swap feature and Apex Exchange. These two will never require KYC.

Good luck

Mexc requires it, but you can without as well, but they're annoying so they might require it at some time in future.

Try bitunix dot com, they have no KYC

You can do that with options I mentioned, most wallets have a swap feature, like exodus, that can swap to mostly any crypto you want without using an exchange.

Topic: There’s a couple out there that don’t require KYC or even account registration, I’ve used ChangeNow & SimpleSwap a couple of times - both are pretty easy to use and fast.

MEXC had no KYC until lately, they now require it for new accounts - if you still have an old registration there you can use it though.

Topic: For onramping from fiat to crypto your only solution would be using a p2p trading platform, the % spread tends to be a bit higher depending on which payment option you’re using.

If you’re looking for non-KYC exchanges for crypto to crypto you could use pretty much any DEX for on chain swaps or go through sites like simpleswap/changenow for cross-chain trades.

Topic: No KYC centralized crypto exchanges will most probably finally scam it's users.
If a centralized crypto exchange is licensed and regulated, then it will require KYC. If a centralized crypto exchange does not require KYC, then is not licensed and not regulated and therefore high-risk.

All exchanges require KYC for you to be able to use their services. Without KYC, the government in that country will not let them operate.

Topic: It is highly risky to use a non-KYC centralized crypto exchange. Because, a non-KYC centralized crypto exchange has no KYC due to it not having the need to have KYC, due to the fact that it is not licensed and not regulated.
Not licensed and not regulated and non-KYC (all at the same time) centralized crypto exchange will make me run away as fast as lightning.
