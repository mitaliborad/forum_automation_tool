Offshore Hosting Guide

Topic: Hello, I am a beginner when it comes to offshore hosting and unfortunately I could not find the right instructions here in the forum.

Can someone point me in the right direction? What do I need and what should I pay attention to? Anonymity is of course number one, but that's not a problem for me.

I plan to host a website for OnlyFans Leaks, but I don't host the files myself but refer to providers like MEGA.

Which offshore hosting provider would be right for my project? I have seen other posts and everyone says something different. Others are already doing this project successfully. Which providers work well for you?

Where can I buy a domain for this project?

Thanks BHW Community

Topic: After searching the internet for 1 million times and asking ChatGPT 2 million times, offshore hosting can protect your data online but if it comes to court they may not be able to do much (of course, not all of them). If you run a website with leaked OnlyFans content, you will face a lot of DMCA complaints because it is illegal to share others' work.

So, if you need hosting that offers the best privacy and ignores some DMCA reports, I would recommend these two for a low budget: Flokinet and Shinjiru. Both are 100% offshore hosts with low DMCA tolerance. For a domain, you also need a provider that offers real domain protection from the WHOIS database, and NJALLA is the best for that.

Not in all countries. How can a copy be illegal? It's just a copy.

That's why there's a lot of DMCA ignoring hosts, because it's not illegal everywhere.

Yes youre right. After reading a lot here thats how it goes. They ignore DMCA until there is a court order coming in.

i would not suggest using them, everything i read about them is negative. They delete you without a warning, take your domains for no reason and dont even refund anything. They gotta be terrible
