One of Jackie Chan's best

Topic User: tazarbm
Topic: This is why the 80s and the 90s were the best decades for movies. This movie in particular (Heart of the Dragon) is especially good because it's one of Jackie Chan's few serious movies, before he moved to America and started acting silly and funny to cater to the dumbed down american people.

When it comes to martial arts movies the 80s Hong Kong productions are unparalleled IMO. Of course, this is not JC's best fighting scene, but it's one of the more realistic and serious ones...

Which DM? Because there are 2 of them (the 2nd one is better IMO)...

Also, no offense intended, but have you watched any of these movies:

Police Story 1
Police Story 2
Project A
Project A II
Wheels On Meals
Dragons Forever
The "My Lucky Stars" series (Winners and Sinners + My Lucky Stars + Twinkle Twinkle Lucky Stars)
Crime Story

I'm asking because - in my opinion - the fight scenes in these movies are comparable to, or surpass those in Drunken Master.

But anyway, DM (the 2nd one) is a masterpiece too, I also have it in my top 10 JC movies

Topic: Most of Jackie Chan's movies are blured together in my memory excepy for the glass bottles/baseball scene from Rumble in the Bronx.
My favorite series is Rush Hour, I know it not the most iconic but 9/10 times, if it's recommended on Netflix, Disney, or Amazon, I'd watch it.

too cheesy (is this the right word??) for my taste, it's only good as a comedy, not as action movie. But to each their own

have you watched the movies that I've mentioned? I will admit that I've not watched Karate Kid, so I can't speak about it

They came out when I was 8 years old, so I guess I just reserve youthful grace for it.

oh, that's a good one! I hate the dialogues (the main villain in particular seems so fake in gestures and it's such a bad actor, that I always skip his dialogues), but the fight scenes and the humour are top notch, it's exactly what you'd expect from a JC movie. Good call

by the way, did you know that JC used to be an extra in Bruce Lee's movies? I've seen a documentary with JC in which he said he was one of those little guys whose asses get kicked in action movies

Anyway, Bruce Lee was great too.... I remember one of his quotes that had stuck with me over the years, he said something like "I don't fear the man who practices 10k kicks once, I fear the man who practices one kick 10k times". So deep.... and real....
