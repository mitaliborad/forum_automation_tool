Topic: Not sure if they will allow you to have another account under the same name, same birthday date, same parents name...you may be rejected, since you are already a previously banned user.

You could buy a stealth Payoneer account or use the docs from someone of your family

Yes i tried but they declined my account application immediately, but how do they know that i am the same person? Should i use a different IBAN account or something else? There must be a catch.

Same name, same birthday date...not sure where are you from and what is exactly mentioned in your driver license and in your ID doc, however, it tends to give them enough information to conclude that you are the same person that has already been banned before. They generally keep your previously informed docs, precisely to check if you were a user before or if it's your first application.

And yes, use a different IBAN and bank account for each new application

But this is automatically declined so they are not checking internal documents or anything, i think they somehow detect me either through IP address, phone number or IBAN. That's why i posted here, maybe someone experienced in this can help me? Someone that is an expert.

Each applications needs to be unique. Use a residential proxy, use a different phone number, use a different bank account, use a different email address, even in this case they may detect you based on your docs, but at least you can try to make it unique with different data.

They can only detect me based on the name and birthday in that case.
Can you tell me if you have experienced with bought Payoneer Accounts? I need a solution for long term.

Are you sure? Are you speaking from experience or just assuming?

I don't think they hard coded it on the name, birth date and country, it's not secure and reliable.

Any finance platform will have a database of banned users. If someone signs up with the exact same name and DoB of course they will look extra closely at the docs you provide them. including the picture of your ID and proof of residential address that you provide. IP is easy to fake, different IBAN and phone number or email address also very easy to fake, they are not stupid. ID is ultimately the only true verification for them

yes but the thing is that they rejected my application after 3 minutes, and i did not provide picture of my ID or anything like that. I know that they will look extra closely but this was rejected automatically by a hard coded script in the back end so my conclusion is that they rejected it based on the IBAN or my ip address.

The easiest thing to do is buy a new account, since you can't create a new account. If you want I can sell you an account.
