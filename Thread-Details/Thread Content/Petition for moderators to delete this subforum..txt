Topic: Yeah but is deleting content a good idea? Maybe these threads still bring some traffic to BHW and messing with these will actually make BHW worse.

A quick run in Ubersuggest showed BHW gets over 60k visits per month and in reality the number will be higher than this for sure.
The section in question must be responsible for a very miniscule traffic out of it.
