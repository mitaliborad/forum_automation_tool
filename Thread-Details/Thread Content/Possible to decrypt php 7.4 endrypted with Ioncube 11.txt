No, decrypting PHP 7.4 files encrypted with ionCube 11 is not practically possible without the original source or loader. It uses strong encryption and obfuscation.

Maybe get the original files or contact the developer.

Topic: Hi @Cipher15 , hopefully its possible for someone. There is great knowledge out there so I am hoping for the best. If the developer had replied perhaps but this is last resort thats why as I now have a webpage that is somehow broken.

Topic: @beverlie - - I testet with some other files, and it work but this file in perticular I got.

Some reason can't decode:
• New version ioncube/zend.
• Corrupted encoded file.
• Requires license file.
• Dynamic Keys.

Topic: Ioncube 11 is pretty tough to crack, but start by checking if there are any encoded headers or footers; sometimes that gives you a clue. Good luck!
