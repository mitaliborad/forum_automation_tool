Topic: Easiest way to understand it is that its like a VPN but... better. You can do VPN-y things like access different locations and itll give you an IP address that isnt your own but its a lot stronger when it comes to keeping you hidden online. You can use it for web scraping or automation or other general marketing or research things. Theres three types; residential, datacenter, and mobile. Each one has its ups and downs. Personally, I like mobile proxies because they tend to be more secure, especially when it comes to doing social media automation. But it is sometimes expensive. Datacenters are cheap but most of the times the IP is already detected so it wont do much good. Residentials are just the standard, middle ground of everything. Basically the only difference between the three is where they get the IP address from. Residential get it from ISP addresses that are given to people for this houses, datacenters come from a literal datacenter that hosts servers (sort of the closest to how VPNs operate) and mobile proxies get IP addresses assigned to mobiles which are harder to ban since at all times more than one person is using it and theyre ever changing. Its really interesting to be honest. Worth looking into for curiosities sake

Topic: Think of a proxy like a middleman between you and the internet. Takes your actions or requests (opening a website, etc.), sends it on your behalf, and then relay's back the response. Useful in helping hide your actual IP address, making you more anonymous online and in a way that's more meaningful than how a VPN goes about it. On top of that, you can use it to view or change how your connection interacts with region specific conditions or content.

Topic: Proxy is good for when you want to search stuff on the internet and not using your real IP address, in order to avoid geo restrictions or bans.

Topic: A proxy is a carnival costume that hides your identity [your IP]. But don’t forget that even in a costume, you can still be recognized -- by your voice, your walk, or your behavior [browser fingerprints, cookies, network fingerprints, etc.]

So for anonymity, remember not only about proxies but also about anti-detect browsers

Topic: A proxy is a server that acts as a middleman between your device and the internet. It hides your real IP address, making it look like your traffic is coming from the proxy's location. Proxies are used for:
Privacy/anonymity.
Bypassing geo-restrictions.
Web scraping or automation.
Common types include residential, datacenter, and mobile proxies.

Topic: Proxies are like digital middle-men; they hide your IP address while you browse, but not all of them are created equal when it comes to security and speed.
