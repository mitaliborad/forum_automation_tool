Topic: Ok.. well... the moment I feared just happened...
I think I am having a mental breakdown right now.... Most of my income is just... gone..
Most of my videos uploaded on eporner is gone...
It was already way too hard for me to take when xhamster and pornhub died.
Now it is just way too much, starting back to 0 now... ah... If I was weak, I would just end my life.
I am just so.... tired... internet keep changing every day and it is just too stressful.. I am just broken.
I miss the old days when I could make money closing my eyes.....

They removed most of the uploaded videos
There are some people on reddit talking about it as well

Can't you just re-upload them all?

There is a famous saying: Never put all your eggs in one basket. Instead, try as many other ways as possible to make money aggressively as soon as possible.

Did you watermark your videos or include any links in the description? Most of these sites will delete videos that push traffic to competing offers (like if they have webcam affiliate links and your watermark is for a site offering the same thing).
