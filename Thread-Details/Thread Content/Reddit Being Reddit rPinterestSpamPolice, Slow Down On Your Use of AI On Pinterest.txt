Reddit Being Reddit r/PinterestSpamPolice, Slow Down On Your Use of AI On Pinterest

Topic: This is classical case of Reddit being Reddit. A few redditors are not okay with the 'excessive' use of AI content on Pinterest so they do what redditors have always been known for, band together to create a spam police sub where they could report suspected AI and spam.

I already have a recent thread discussing Reddit moderation. Clearly, members aren't any different. This is not substantially different from those guys who complained about your use of PBNs and other blackhat SEO methods.


While, I agree excessive use of AI isn't good but why not let the platform do it their way?

I also have a recent live thread talking about the attention AI content on Pinterest is attracting. An article discussing these AI content was published on a major publication.

I don't want to link to the reddit sub but you can see it in the title.

As far as I know, not yet. But with actions like those of redditor, it'll soon be against AI content.

Topic: AI doesn't invent anything new. Humans created all the content it uses.
If you proofread the content before posting, I don't believe anyone can tell the difference.
At least it has worked for me so far.
