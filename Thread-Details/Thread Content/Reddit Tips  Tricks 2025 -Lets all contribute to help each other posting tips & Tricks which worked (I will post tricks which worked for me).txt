Topic: What kind of proxy and browsing uses do you all recommend for Reddit?

What kind of warmup works best before you post a link?

--

My tip for Reddit is:

Don't rush with link building from Reddit on popular sub-reddit they always gets wasted. Focus on small or moderate accounts and focus to be relevant.

No matter how careful you use the account, a bad IP will spoil the account sooner or later.
