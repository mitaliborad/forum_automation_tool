Topic: Why not setup your own smtp on a vps server?? My current setup can send 80k to 500k a day using a desktop mailer .. The thing about my setup it can rotate FROM address and subdomain to avoid spam filters something like this -


#RANDOMNAME#@#RANDOMNAME-NUMBERS#.domain.com

Everytime email is sent the FROM address is sending different including subdomain, it rotates name before @ and the subdomains.

ALL SPF / RDNS / MX / TXT - pass


Can send 80k to 500k a day using a desktop mailer.
If someone needs help .. dont hesitate to ask .. my skype is same as my username
