Topic: Hello all , I saw many YouTube channels uploading the anime I'm watching. There are at least 100+ channels, each with 100,000 to 500,000 sub. Each video has at least 10,000 to 30,000 views. They are all uploading the same new est episode or a mashup of a few episodes, or even 3 to 5 hours of the entire season in one video. Please note that they are not presenting anime reaction or explaination content; it is pure animation showing the full episodes.


I was wondering why they don't get struck down. Is it because the anime creators don't care about striking them down?

Yes, they video are monetise. Seem like easy money

Topic: YouTube's algorithm doesn't always catch them right away, as YouTube has an automated system called Content ID, which isn't perfect and some pirated content can slip through if not flagged or reported.

Topic: The trick is: change the frame on each 7s, meaning that you should always cut the video on each 7s. never go above 7s without a cut & zoom in or out.
