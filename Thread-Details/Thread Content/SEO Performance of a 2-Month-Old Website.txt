SEO Performance of a 2-Month-Old Website

Topic: Are these clicks and impressions good for a 2-month-old domain?


Hey everyone,


I launched a new website two months ago, and I started indexing some pages on January 23rd. Right now, the site is about 85% complete, and I still have a lot of content to upload.


So far, these are my Google Search Console stats:


Total clicks: 5.23K
Total impressions: 25.2K
CTR: 20.8%
Average position: 22.8

The domain is completely new and currently has a domain authority of 8 on Semrush.


Are these results normal for this stage, or is there something I should improve?


Thanks in advance!

The results are great, most new websites don't start to pick up that soon. Seems you've done the right keyword research.

I'm surprised you are getting 20% CTR, that is actually high especially when the average position is 20+

Topic: The website has only been established for 2 months and has clicks, views, and is in the top position like this is too great.
You should try to maintain this, no need to change anything, staying on top is fine.

Topic: Yes, these results are quite good for a 2-month-old domain. Getting 5.23K clicks and 25.2K impressions in such a short time shows that your website is gaining traction. A 20.8% CTR is also impressive, indicating that your content is relevant and engaging. The average position of 22.8 suggests that some of your pages are ranking well, but there is room for improvement.
To grow further, continue adding high-quality content, improving on-page SEO, and building backlinks to increase domain authority. Keep monitoring performance and optimizing underperforming pages. You're on the right track!

Topic: A click-through rate this high is really rare. For a website with at least dozens of articles and long-term operation, the click-through rate is usually between 3% and 8%. I have no idea how you managed to reach 20%—could you share your experience?
