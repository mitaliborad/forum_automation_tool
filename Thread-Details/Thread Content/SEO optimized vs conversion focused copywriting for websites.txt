SEO optimized vs conversion focused copywriting for websites

Topic: Hi,

We're in the process of building a website for a service-based company and have been reviewing our competitors' service pages. We've noticed that these pages are often lengthy and highly optimized for SEO, but they lack a lively tone and don't seem crafted to convert visitors effectively.

This observation has us wondering why this approach is so prevalent. We aim to create service pages that mainly focus on converting visitors , all while ensuring our articles are SEO-optimized with relevant keywords. But our page will clearly not be as seo optimized as those competitors.

We want to have those super optimized page for our articles, not our main website ...

Could you share your insights on whether this strategy might be misguided and, if so, why? I find it hard to believe that all our competitors are missing the mark, so I'm sure there are valid reasons behind their approach.

Thank you in advance for your thoughts!

Could you please elaborate just a little as to why not having separate articles seo optimized and a website that converts fully isn't best practice so I can explain this to my team ?

I'd love to understand

IMO, a mixture of both approaches is needed.
If you look at big brands, they do not seo optimised their homepage, or other converting pages. Usually there's name, moto, enticing images in there. Not much content!
Classic SEOs however, believe that homepage is the most important page for seo optimization.
I would keep blog posts for SEO optimisation and homepage and other landing pages for conversion.

The main domain holds more juice so it's better to have seo optimized page on it as much as possible to increase your DA as much as possible

At least that's what I got from some research

Homepage receive most links, but I would use it to showcase internal pages, instead of keyword optimisation with content.

I'm thinking about content, so doing keyword research and making sure enough relevant keywords are in the page.

If I do a high converting page without seo in mind, the page will be much shorter and I will mainly try to convince visitors to submit my form if that makes sense
