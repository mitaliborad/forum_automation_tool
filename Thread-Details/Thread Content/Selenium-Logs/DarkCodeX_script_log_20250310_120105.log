When I haven't turned on the proxy, everything is normal, but when I finish configuring ublock origin and closing the browser, assigning the proxy, I see this message "This extension was turned off because it is no longer supported" and I have to reopen it manually. But the bad thing is that even though I block ads, the capacity is still much larger than before.
i don't understand why
