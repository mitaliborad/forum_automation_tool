2025-03-10 12:23:19,999 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Hi guys,

I have issue with Twitter Mass Mentions in that I have used over 2,000 twitter accounts to mass mention over 100k users/accounts which I scraped from some crypto influencers.

So far, the first 500 where suspended before I could finish the 100k, the second 500 also suspended and I decided to buy 1,300 accounts as i speak, 1,000 of them are showing restricted (restricted because I stopped adding links to the post with links i goes suspended)

Can someone please share with me what could be wrong?

I do not use twtgo and twitterdub or any other software.
I use my own software written personally in python

I can see about 3 accounts in my notification mass-mentioning me frequently, in less than 24hours they get over 100k views.

What am I doing wrong?

If you are willing to share some tips to help me get better result, I can add functionalities to suite your custom need if you are also into mass-mentioning.
My script uses the Twitter Internal API to get things done without the official rate limits.

I don't mind donating for the information.
