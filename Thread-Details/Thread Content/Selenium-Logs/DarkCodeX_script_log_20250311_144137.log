So from what I understood there's ad cloaking and payment cloaking, but there's few informations I found on payment cloaking (linking the products between the white shop and black shop), it this step not obligatory to run my business ? (i wanna try launching a replica luxury brand business).
I understood that ad cloaking is absolutely necessary to effectively reach audience on google ads but what is payment cloaking necessary for ? Is it that payment processor will get quickly blocked at the first customer that ask a refund/dispute.


I'm tryna learn how to cloaking ads and payments but if there's good services that would do that for me here I'm open to hear proposals.
If a kind soul is okay to explain to me in details would be grateful as well,

Thanks in advance guys.
