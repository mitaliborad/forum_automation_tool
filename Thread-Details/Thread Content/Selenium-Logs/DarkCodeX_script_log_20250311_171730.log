2025-03-11 17:21:05,727 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Hello, I know people have turned extra cell phone lines into mobile proxies.

Am I ok to run a hotspot from an extra phone and just turn the internet on and off to get a new ip?
I am running android on a pixel phone in the USA. Will sites be able to see that I am running a hotspot from a phone?

My cell provider is throttling me to 5ge is that an issue or a give away?

I am making new accounts on reddit with adspower and I am having some difficulty in getting posts through. I am warming my accounts up for like 10 days sometimes with 100+ Karma and I am still having my posts removed. This makes me think it might be a proxy issue.

Any advice would be much appreciated!
