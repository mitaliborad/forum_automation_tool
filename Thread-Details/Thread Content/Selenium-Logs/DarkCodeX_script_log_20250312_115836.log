2025-03-12 12:00:52,077 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Hey BHW Fam,

I’m diving deep into native ads and looking for ways to exploit CPA offers to generate high-value sales in USA, Australia, NZ, Spain, and Canada. My goal is to scale up and hit premium payouts, but I need some insights from those who’ve cracked the system.

Here’s what I’m working with:


• Running native ads (Taboola, Outbrain, Revcontent, MGID, etc.)


• Targeting Tier 1 GEOs


• Promoting high-ticket CPA offers


• Focused on verticals like finance, health, insurance, and sweepstakes

Questions:


1. What’s the best ad angle & pre-lander setup for these GEOs to get high EPCs?


2. How do you optimize for high-ticket conversions rather than low-value leads?


3. Which networks have the highest CPA rates for these verticals?


4. Any cloaking or funnel tricks to improve ad approvals & conversions?


5. Is it better to buy aged domains for trust, or run everything through a fresh site with a strong funnel?


I’m open to testing strategies and will share results if I find a winning formula. Appreciate any insights from those who’ve had success in these markets!


Looking forward to your advice.


Cheers!
