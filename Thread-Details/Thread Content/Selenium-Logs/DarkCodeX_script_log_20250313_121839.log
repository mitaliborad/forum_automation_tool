2025-03-13 12:21:20,739 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Hi guys,

I own one of the most active adult content pages on X (specifically feet pics) and I have been reached out by a company that has a website dedicated to selling feet. They want me to promote their website for one month to test how it goes. My posts get between 600-1.5k likes and over 100k views. They want to pay me $750 for the one month of me promoting their site (2x posts per week so 8 posts total).

Does this sound like a fair trade? What I know is I will bring more traffic to their website but not sure if what they are offering me is fair? I'm not desperate for money so please give me your thoughts on this if you've been through similar situations.

Thank you
