2025-03-13 14:09:06,396 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Hello everyone !
Right now I have 4 telegrams numbers under the same telegram app that I have on my mobile phone, but I want to have 6 additional numbers (for a total of 10 numbers in the end).
But I can't add a new one, telegram tells me that I have reached the maximum numbers (4).
So I tried to buy numbers on an online service that provides phone numbers and tried to create a new telegram on another session of my computer, but I don't receive the verification SMS code and the phone call to receive the code. I searched online and I saw that the phone numbers I bought are probably "blacklisted" as VOIP numbers etc...

So my question is :

What setup would you do in order to have 10 telegrams numbers and to keep these 10 accounts for a long time ? (2-3 years minimum, and not just a oneshot for few days)
