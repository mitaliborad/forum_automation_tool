2025-04-01 09:53:01,485 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Hello, I am planning to open a mobile proxy farm with 100 USB dongles, and I have a budget of 15,000 USD. I have a few questions and I hope some of you are able to answer them:

1. What CPU do you recommend for a proxy server?
2. Will 3proxy handle that much traffic on a single server?
3. How fast of an internet connection should I have? Fiber-optic internet cannot be installed there, so I can only have unlimited 5G internet with download speeds up to 5.4 Gb/s and upload speeds of 500 Mb/s, with a bandwidth of up to 3000 Mb/s assuming the best coverage.
4. Are there better dongles available than the Huawei e3372h-153 for this purpose?

Thank you for your help. I appreciate any advice or suggestions you can provide.
