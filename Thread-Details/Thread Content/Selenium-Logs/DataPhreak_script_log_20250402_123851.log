2025-04-02 12:42:26,741 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: I'm trying to figure out how to keep mobile proxy costs manageable when running hundreds of 'aged' Adspower profiles across several team members.

The challenge I'm facing is that we need to perform many small-value actions, each requiring proxy use, but the typical costs of mobile proxies ($30-50 each/month or high pay-per-GB rates) make this hard to scale economically.

Has anyone found effective solutions for:
- More affordable mobile proxy providers for this type of use case?
- Strategies for proxy rotation or sharing to reduce total number needed?
- Ways to minimize data usage without compromising stealth performance?
- Alternative approaches for large-scale operations?

Any insights from those who've tackled similar scaling issues would be greatly appreciated!

(Please don't send me the proxy marketplace, as it will not help in this case)
