2025-04-09 11:06:42,357 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Hi guys,

I would like to share with you my opinion after having tried a lot of panels here with ALL the differents services they sell for Youtube.
Natives views, CTR, Ads targeted, RAV, monetizable, SEO views, Unique Real, HR, discovery, Niche related and many others...

Belive me my video quality /thumb/SEO are very nice. Don't jump on this please

ANY panels provide me a good ranking for my videos and allow me to get suggested, reach home page, get natural reach or anything else.

You can easily imagine I spent a good amount of money though to MAYBE find a good service.
I think there is some service that work but I never found it. So here me 2 cents, don't waste your money. If you want to build autority by just increasing your number of stats it's ok but thats it.

Goole is not fool, he want your subscribers watch a nice percentage of you video, click on notifications and here he will suggest your video.
The best is to have your own private network with google pva account and proxy. Again, maybe there are some services but don't you think I already found it since I'm on this forum ?
Guys continue to maintain the myth so people will continue to spend money and believe they will find something...LOL

Again just my 2 cents, I would like to be wrong believe me
See ya
