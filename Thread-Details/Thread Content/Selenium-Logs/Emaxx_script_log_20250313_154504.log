I have a WordPress adult site built with WP script. I have the PHP version at 7.2 and I should bring it to at least 7.4 but when I switch to the new ones my site goes down with the classic “ 404 error page not found” .
I don’t know if is a problem with some plugin or the Retrotube theme that I’m using.
I hope anyone can help me
