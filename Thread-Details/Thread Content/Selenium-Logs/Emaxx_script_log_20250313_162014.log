2025-03-13 16:25:00,937 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Are these clicks and impressions good for a 2-month-old domain?


Hey everyone,


I launched a new website two months ago, and I started indexing some pages on January 23rd. Right now, the site is about 85% complete, and I still have a lot of content to upload.


So far, these are my Google Search Console stats:


Total clicks: 5.23K
Total impressions: 25.2K
CTR: 20.8%
Average position: 22.8

The domain is completely new and currently has a domain authority of 8 on Semrush.


Are these results normal for this stage, or is there something I should improve?


Thanks in advance!
