2025-04-01 09:37:54,739 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: I built a directory website and now I want to monetize it with affiliate links, but I don't want it to be obvious.

Instead of just adding the link is there some tool (ideally free) that "hide" the links so they don't look like affiliate links.

So instead of the link being something like http://www.affiliateprogram.com/r/ABCD it will just show up as something less obvious?

I would apply this to all the links in the directory to further cloak the links.
