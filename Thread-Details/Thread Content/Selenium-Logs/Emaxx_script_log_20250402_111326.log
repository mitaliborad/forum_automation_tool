2025-04-02 11:16:11,117 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: I have a question, I can't recall, but when using if statements. I know when using == towards letters you have to use single quotes. For example if(variable == 'dog'){ this is true}

However, are numbers different. I think this code below would execute to true if the $starcard variable matched the number or do I need to put the number into single quotes?

Clearly, I am going to test it, but just making sure to avoid any issues.

if($strcard == 533248){
will be true?
}else{}
