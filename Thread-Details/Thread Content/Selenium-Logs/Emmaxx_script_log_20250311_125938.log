2025-03-11 13:03:56,123 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: hey guys, i do some reddit stuff and scraping and i am tired of using shitty proxies or overpriced mobile proxies. i have a few old androids sitting around and i can get pretty cheap sims and data plan in my country. how would i convert these phones to their own proxy servers / a tiny mobile proxy farm? i am not looking to sell these etc. just for my own personal use so i know my proxies that i am using are secure and only used by me. if i can make them rotate that would be great but if not it’s not a biggie either.

all tips / recommendations are very welcome
