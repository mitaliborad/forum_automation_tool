2025-03-11 14:19:21,659 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: YouTube is tightening its rules on gambling content, banning videos that promote uncertified sites and apps. This article covers the key changes and their impact on creators and affiliate marketers.

Starting March 19, 2025, Google is tightening YouTube's policy on online gambling content: posting videos that advertise gambling sites and apps that are not certified by Google or approved by YouTube will be prohibited.


Any links, including those embedded in images, text, or verbal mentions, as well as graphic elements and logos redirecting viewers to a site or app that has not been approved, will be banned.
Additionally, content featuring images or promotions of online casino sites or apps that do not violate Community Guidelines will be subject to age restrictions. If a user is under 18 or not logged into their account, YouTube simply won’t show such videos (except for online sports betting and personal gambling images).
Videos promising a "guaranteed win" may be removed even for approved online gambling sites or apps. Previously, YouTube implemented similar measures against fake medical advice, AI content manipulation, and videos about eating disorders.
More details in Google Help Center.
