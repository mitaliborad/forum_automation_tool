2025-03-11 16:41:46,187 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: I need a lot of Twitter followers frequently and used already multiple panels with mixed succes

JAP, pacysmm, socialpanel24, smmpasa, dripfeedpanel, fivebbc, bestsmmprovider, realsite - to name a few

all of them can't deliver their promises, drops, bad support, pending orders are nothing special

I also had orders filled on time but you can't rely on them, today it works tomorrow will not even if you buy the most expensive orders they offer

From few days after last Twitter update there are massive problems with Twitter followers, from what I see there is no single service that can deliver stable followers right now, all i bought in last 3 days from multiple services (advertised on this forum) dropped already, despite I always buy only the most expensive orders with refill guarantee

so what are you using right now to get Twitter followers? any luck?

share your experience please, like this we will be able to figure out where to look to get Twitter followers today
