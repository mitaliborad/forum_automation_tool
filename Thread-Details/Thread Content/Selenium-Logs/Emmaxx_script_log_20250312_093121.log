2025-03-12 09:35:22,285 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: I'm convinced that 90% of people are unaware that borrowing money on the blockchain is a reality. Thanks to DeFi, platforms like Compound, Aave, and MakerDAO have made it possible for individuals to lend and borrow from each other, bypassing traditional banking systems that charge exorbitant interest rates. That’s why whenever I hear people say DeFi is dead, I just laugh. Recent projects emerging from the DeFi space clearly demonstrate a strong focus on building for the future. For instance, opportunities like locking BGB and DEUSD to receive a share of $ELX—courtesy of the new Bitget Launchpool for Elixir—are thriving within the ecosystem. And that’s not even mentioning other opportunities in DAO, Aave, and the modular decentralized finance protocol, $ELX. Don't sleep on DeFi. I suggest you explore it further.
