I haven't had any IT experience/background prior to that.

You can pretty much pay for software of any social media, with customer support and detailed instructions.
There is also much more in social media automation/spamming than just a script, because you have to know the underground methods of not getting banned or shadowbanned. For other python projects like i.e web automation, there are already many programmers I could hire even on BHW to do the job

So I've started thinking...is all that effort really worth it? Am I spending months of my free time just to save few hundred bucks on softwares?
After all I'm trying only to build something of my own, don't want to provide python services as that just another job with a tiny bit more of a freedom, and for most social medias there are already softwares - and with knowing just a little bit of python I wouldn't get a day job either.

What do you think? Is there some other opportunities with having python skills I'm not aware of? or am I missing something here in general?
Oh and another thing - learning a library and it's syntax is like learning a mini-programming language every god damn time...and every project is a different major library, excluding helpers like time,datetime etc
