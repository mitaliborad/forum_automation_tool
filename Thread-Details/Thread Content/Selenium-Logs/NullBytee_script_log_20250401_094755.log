I have used this method for all types of GMB categories: cleaning, real estate agent, marketing agency.

It takes time! No quick number to verify GMB listing.

1. Buy PR release on Fiverr

2. The website is already 50% filled with content

3. Download WPmaps and enter your locations using the Google Maps API

4. Buy another PR release.

5. Wait approximately 5 weeks

It worked for me 17 times out of 28 verifications
