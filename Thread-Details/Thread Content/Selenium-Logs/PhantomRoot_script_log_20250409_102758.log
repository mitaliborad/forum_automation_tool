2025-04-09 10:30:05,846 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: I recently purchased a guest post through several sellers.
We also checked the DR score and the quality of the backlinks that the domain has.
What I think is important is the traffic on the guest posting website.
For that reason, I first received a domain list from the sellers and then tried it by selecting the domain I wanted and purchasing it.


However, I have a question here.

It's been sold by BHW for a long time, and I've accessed the homepage of a seller with a lot of buyers.
He was providing a high-quality guest posting service. Of course, he didn't provide a domain list first.

There are also quite a few buyers and repurchasers, so I trusted them and bought 10 links.
It's been a week, and I received the report.
The domain was examined by Ahrefs.

DR score is 50+, but traffic is zero.
Can a website with zero traffic be applied to my money site with a high quality backlink?
