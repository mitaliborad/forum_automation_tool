2025-04-02 12:41:56,108 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: I need to do TikTok marketing for some apps, never did this before but in the last few weeks I've read a lot of content from multiple sources and some threads here in BHW were the most helpful one.

But, the problem is that after reading +100 threads I still don't get what's the best setup.

Some people say the best is to use Mobile Proxies with rotating IPs, other say static Residential Proxies are the best, others say you shouldn't use proxy and instead use just a US e-SIM...

What I already know:
- I bought an used iPhone from eBay
- I will factory reset it with a new US Apple ID
- I will have a maximum of 3 accounts per platform per device
- I will create a brand new TikTok account and warm it up interacting like a user for a week with my target audience

Questions:
- Residential Proxy vs. Mobile Proxy ? Should I use static or let the IPs rotate?
- Is it ok to use pay-per-GB proxy provider?
- Can I use cheaper proxy providers although with good ratings(Soax, Evomi, DataImpulse)?
- If I use a proxy will I still need a us e-SIM? Even if I create the TT account with email instead of phone number?
- The best way to setup the proxy is using apps like Shadowrocket or on the network itself?

This forum is really helpful, thanks!
