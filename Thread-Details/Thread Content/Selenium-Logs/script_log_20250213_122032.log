2025-02-13 12:22:19,277 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: I've been working on some instagram project lately... just testing algorithms and so on.
For me to test, I signed up using protonmail email with my rooted phone.
I have intercepted all the traffic, had a browse through which logs are sent and so on.
I notice they use play integrity like most apps nowadays, my device passes that.
However, upon registration my account was suspended instantly.
I haven't been using my IP to create tons of accounts; this is my first time. However, I do have another Instagram account thats years old. That's my only IP tie to Instagram.

I'm trying to figure out why exactly they suspended it instantly. I suppose the APK I tested with had a patched SSL bypass, which may be marked by Instagram by now.
I will bypass their SSL pinning pretty easily anyway, despite which version. I used the patched version just to test.

I also attempted to sign up via browser, and was hit with the following error:
"Sorry, something went wrong while creating your account. Please try again soon." which to me screams they have marked my IP, or temporarily limited it.

So my thoughts right now:
The patched SSL pinning APK is maybe marked/patched by Instagram now, and they auto ban accounts that are registered from it.
They don't like ProtonMail
They don't like forwarded mails.
They don't like devices that don't meet play integrity (MEETS_STRONG_INTEGRITY)

If anyone wants to share their thoughts or experience, please do.
