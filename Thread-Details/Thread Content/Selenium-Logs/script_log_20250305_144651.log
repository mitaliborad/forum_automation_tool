2025-03-05 14:49:11,851 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Hi,

We're in the process of building a website for a service-based company and have been reviewing our competitors' service pages. We've noticed that these pages are often lengthy and highly optimized for SEO, but they lack a lively tone and don't seem crafted to convert visitors effectively.

This observation has us wondering why this approach is so prevalent. We aim to create service pages that mainly focus on converting visitors , all while ensuring our articles are SEO-optimized with relevant keywords. But our page will clearly not be as seo optimized as those competitors.

We want to have those super optimized page for our articles, not our main website ...

Could you share your insights on whether this strategy might be misguided and, if so, why? I find it hard to believe that all our competitors are missing the mark, so I'm sure there are valid reasons behind their approach.

Thank you in advance for your thoughts!
