Topic: Anything will do, because the bottleneck here is the network request, and not the code itself. You could even do it with node, go or rust as well.

Topic: It really depends on the type of trading and if time is crucial.

It sounds like it’s to work on an algorithm so i would say whichever you are more proficient in.

Topic: The trade computer is 30k per day that was 15 years ago, to connect to in trading platform.

Even a split second will lose bids or sales.

It the trade connection that stop any programmer try.

And ones that scrape no good don't work as it split seconds needed.

Even offices that trade move near to the trade servers why the rent in the air, just to be close to trading building.

There even court cases of glitch of trades that traders try on everyday.

It a very hard business to get into, your need to be vetted and have mllions to be a proper trade contender for your application to be approved. .

Leval 3 server house wanted 1 million for the line only, not the bandwidth,super computers only.

Tradeing application no joke.

There always news on trading about who speed glitch, billions lost daily over Internet speeds.

You best join Facebook trader groups those that run application that are popular and vetted programmers there loads around, but I no for a fact joining there program to trade in the thousands and expected to have money or they just kick you off the group stright away.

Topic: I guess it depends on the poster's goal. I assumed that it was more of a test an algorithm vs manual trades.

Those high-speed trades from the big names are using massive amounts of cash to compete so the average joe isn't going to even be able to get remotely close.

However, if it a tool that would pull daily trades, look for indicators, and then make trades based on a formula as opposed to doing all the work by hand, there is a lot of leeway there.

I would still go with C++ myself as a software engineer but for many python may be much easier to get into it with all of the modules available.

Topic: Python should be better if you’re focused on visualization. C++ if you want to handle more data.

If you're building an algorithmic trading bot, go with Python. It's easier to learn, has great libraries (like Pandas and NumPy), and is widely used in finance. Python is more beginner-friendly and allows you to focus on the trading logic. C++ is powerful but usually better for system-level programming; Python is a smoother choice for algorithmic trading. Happy coding and trading.

Topic: Wtf, why people be recommending python?

Strict time bounds call for non-garbage collected languages. Traditional garbage collection may introduce unpredictable pauses into an execution of an application, that is when the GC swipes out unused objects.

You may use real time garbage collectors; with it you will introduce high operational overhead.

Topic: Well in my experience, if you are really finessed about controlling resources (large scale shi), i'd use c++, since you'll have more control over the algorithm, more performance, and also the biggest of all **MULTITHREADING** lmao, but it will only go so far, since the main problem would be the requests to the server ;p
