Topic: Yes, they should learn about promotion and if they can’t they should probably hire someone who can. Social media is evolving everyday and we should learn to follow the trend.

Topic: Yes, with the decreasing reliability of SEO, every blogger should diversify their traffic sources. Promoting content on social media is a great alternative because it allows direct engagement with the audience without relying on search engine algorithms.


In addition to social media, other strategies like email marketing, networking with other creators, and creating engaging content (videos, infographics, podcasts) can help increase a blog’s visibility. SEO is still useful, but it should no longer be the only strategy.
