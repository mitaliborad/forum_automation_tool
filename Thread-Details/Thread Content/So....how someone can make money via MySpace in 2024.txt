I'm surprised that MySpace still has a section in Blackhat World. MySpace died since the rise of Facebook by the end of the 00s, and many people who are under 20 right now, they're not aware of its existence.

So the question is, how someone can make money out of a music news site this year? Because that's what MySpace is now. A music news site.

Topic: I mean, why bother? I still found adult spam on MySpace when looking for methods on there. Simply just browse and see if someone is doing something and replicate if u can.

This is the first result I get, and the article is obviously very old.

And also this from 2010 when MySpace was on its last legs

I've never heard anybody claiming they made money from MySpace these days. Now it's a music news site isn't it? How can you make money from a music news site? The only possibility to make money from it is if Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and TikTok stop existing and people get back to MySpace. If not globally, regionally.

How is this a serious, non-sarcastic reply, when we all know there's almost no traffic within MySpace?
