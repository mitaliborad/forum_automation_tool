Topic: Hi!

I need your help in learning how to promote a travel vlog and blog.

Both have a lot of content and have been active for years.

I'd like the videos to do better. But I just can't seem to get more views on the videos.

The videos are pretty fun, not badly edited, and there's a lot of info about visiting places.

Any ideas please?

Topic: Do you embed the videos at the top of your blog posts? I tend to create videos for YouTube then embed the link at the beginning of a post, and am considering creating an audio version but as my posts are niche already I think the traffic for the audibly impaired wouldn't justify the effort at present. Using it as an embed will help keep your loading time down, direct traffic back towards YouTube as presumably your blog users are clicking on the blog posts anyway. You could similarly try this with Vimeo, Tik Tok etc but I'd lean towards YouTube for monetisation options

Topic: To promote your travel vlog and blog, focus on SEO, social media, and audience engagement. Use relevant keywords in video titles, descriptions, and tags to improve search rankings. Share videos on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter with eye-catching captions. Engage with viewers by replying to comments and asking questions. Collaborate with other travel creators to reach a wider audience. Create short clips for TikTok and YouTube Shorts to attract new viewers. Also, embed videos in your blog posts and optimize them for Google searches. Consistency and interaction will help boost your views over time.
