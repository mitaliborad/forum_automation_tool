Sudden Drop in Views on My YouTube Shorts – What’s Going On?

Topic User: Señor Nermal
Topic: I started posting on YouTube about 15 days ago, sharing 4-5 edited viral videos that have been performing well on TikTok. At first, things were going great—I had multiple viral videos and gained 980 subscribers in just three days.

However, over the past week, my latest Shorts have been getting almost no views (between 1-3 views, some even stuck at 0). The sudden drop is strange, and I can’t figure out why.

One thing I changed before the decline was adding a Beacons link to my profile URL, which I removed shortly after. I don’t know if this is just a coincidence or if it somehow affected my reach.

Has anyone else experienced something similar? Could adding an external link have triggered some sort of limitation? Any insights would be greatly appreciated!

Topic: There are a few factors that might be at play here, and I think it's likely not just a coincidence with the Beacons link. YT's algorithm can sometimes be finicky, especially when it comes to changes like adding external links in your bio. I’ve heard that links to external sites, especially ones that could potentially lead viewers away from YT, can sometimes cause the algorithm to throttle your reach as a cautionary measure. I think your content might still be in the "testing phase" within YT’s system. This is super common early on, as YT algorithms try to figure out where your videos should go and how to rank them.

Personally, I’d recommend taking a close look at your analytics in YT Studio to pinpoint exactly when the drop started and see if there are any other patterns at play, like changes in audience retention or shifts in traffic sources. I also find it helpful to use tools like TubeBuddy to get additional insights and ideas for adjustments. In my view, the best course of action is to keep focusing on creating engaging, quality content while monitoring your stats over the next couple of weeks, sometimes these dips are just temporary as the system tests and balances out your channel’s performance. Just hang in there and experiment a bit; things often bounce back once the algorithm settles down.

Adding external links cannot trigger any limitations on your videos. Sudden drops in views are normal especially for shorts videos.
