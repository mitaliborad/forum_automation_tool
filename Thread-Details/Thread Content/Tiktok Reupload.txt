To monetize better, focus on growing your followers to at least 1,000 so you can add a clickable link. For now, try using a custom landing page on your own domain instead of third-party services to avoid warnings. As for DMs, engage naturally and consider promoting a relevant offer or directing users to a private community where you can monetize further.

100 profile views per video is good. You can monetize through URL Shorteners that pay well.

Topic: You could try Koji or Direct.me to avoid the link warning. Also, engaging with your DMs and building trust can help drive conversions.
