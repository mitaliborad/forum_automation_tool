Tiktok Views

Topic: My TikTok videos reach around 800-900 views, and I use TikTok Mod, so the issue isn’t with the app. Could it be due to the quality of the videos I post? How can I improve to get higher views?

To get more views on TikTok, make sure your vids grab attention fast, use trending sounds and hashtags, and post consistently with clean, engaging content. Check what’s working, talk to your followers, and keep your edits sharp. If needed, try boosting a vid with ads to reach more people

On the other hand, there is room for 'out of norms' things on tiktok Stuff like people filming spiders and snakes, are making a lot of views

Topic: if you want to switch things up, those reddit stories always get an insane amount of views. Worth a try. As for why youre getting shadowbanned, could be anything from your videos not reaching enough audiences or youre posting at wrong times. Gotta keep trying out strategies until you find one that works.

My problem is that my TikTok videos stop gaining views once they reach 800-900 views. I know the reason is that there isn’t enough engagement with the videos for TikTok’s algorithm to push them to the next stage of exposure. I don’t know how to improve this or what I should do. I work on gaming content, take clips, edit them, and reupload them.

I’m also working on Reddit, and I’ve started using an old account for this purpose.

Yes, quality of videos is important. You should make better videos, try to copy videos which are already trending in search and other places.

i read a few comments on your inst thread.
if i use adobe premiere pro, will the old metadata from re-used vids stick after encoding it? you said in the thread you use capcut but i was under impresion capcut reuses metadata and this will trigger tt insane inspections on ur vid. or do you completely change the effects/styling/captions/etc. of the vids? doing all that is completely new vid though. im ok with doin all that i just wan be somewhat sure and not waste time on it. i know everything takes time and effort and hit or miss with tt though, even with new content

Topic: In TikTok, the number of views on a video can vary greatly depending on a number of factors, including the quality of the content, the timing of the post, the target audience, and the promotion strategy, among others. According to Statista, TikTok videos posted by personal accounts have an average of about 32,108 views, and in the case of business accounts, it has a slightly lower average of 23,782 views. Your current situation is indeed an abnormal amount of playback.

That’s definitely possible since TikTok tends to push high-quality, engaging content. Try improving video resolution, adding trending sounds, and keeping viewers hooked in the first few seconds. Experimenting with different formats and engagement strategies might also help boost your reach.
