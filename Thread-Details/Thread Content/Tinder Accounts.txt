Topic: Hello guys, i want to make Tinder accounts across other countries.
I would like to know which tool do you use to bypass the geolocation?
Are you using VPN, proxies, or something else?
I am planning to use a clean new reseted iphone, with USA number, USA icloud.

Best way to do it:
4G/LTE mobile proxies from the target country (VPNs alone aren’t enough).
GPS spoofing app (iTools for iPhone, Fake GPS for Android).
Fresh SIM card from the country you want to appear in.
Match your phone’s time zone to the location.
Don’t switch locations too fast and avoid bot-like behavior. That should work.

If you’re looking for the best way to bypass geolocation, high-quality residential or mobile proxies tend to work better than VPNs, as they provide more natural browsing behavior. Also, make sure your GPS location matches your proxy to avoid detection. Using a clean, reset iPhone with a consistent setup can help reduce the risk of flags or bans.

Topic: You can use a GPS spoofing app to change your location and a mobile proxy for a more legit setup. A good VPN works too, but proxies are usually better for multiple accounts. Just make sure everything looks natural to avoid bans.

To create and stably use a Tinder account in another country/region, you must bypass its strict geolocation and anti-fraud system, which includes:
Device fingerprinting
IP reputation checks
Payment method verification
Behavioral analysis

do you want to create multiple tinder accounts? if not, I think your method is fine.
- to change IP address, both VPN or proxy is Ok, but don't use free one because their IP address probably is blacklisted
- for reseted iphone, change region and language on your phone too.
