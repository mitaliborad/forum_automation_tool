I know of some companies who are having fake reviews constantly added every hour.

They also have a different website listed there that forwards the link to their actual website.

Does anybody know how to do this? I have 15 bad reviews (Fake reviews) from compeitors...


I'm struggling with how to get rid of them, can I change my name somehow? forward the website? What can I do? Please and thank you in advance
