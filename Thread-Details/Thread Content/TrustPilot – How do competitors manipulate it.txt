TrustPilot – How do competitors manipulate it?

Topic User: Newbie0
Topic: Hi everyone,

I’m new to TrustPilot and trying to understand how some competitors seem to be gaming the system.

A bunch of them have around 2,000+ 5-star reviews, with new ones rolling in every few hours. Meanwhile, they have fewer than ten 1-star reviews, and their history of flagged reviews is almost non-existent. Due to the nature of our business (supplement industry / every body is different / different expectations etc.), it would not make sense that they almost have zero negative reviews...

Is that actually legit? Or does anyone know what tactics might be at play? For example, is it possible to request TrustPilot to remove flagged review statistics? As in, when flagged reviews get successfully deleted, is there a way to get TrustPilot to also erase the record that they were flagged in the first place?

Would love to hear any insights!
