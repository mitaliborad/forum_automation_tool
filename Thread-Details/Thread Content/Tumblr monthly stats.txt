Topic: Is there a way to get a cumulative notes count from all the original posts for the entire month even if archive is disabled?

This tool https://jetblackcode.com/TumblrStats has it but it doesn't work with blogs which have archives disabled.

Topic: As long as the blog is public/ you have access to it, you might be able to get around that through Tumblr's API. Privated or password-protected ones aside, I can see this being done. Not familiar with extensions that do that specifically though so you might have to rely on custom coded tools for it.

Topic: That's a tricky one! Have you tried looking at the Tumblr API directly to see if it offers any clues?
