Twitter clickable videos?

Topic: Hi all.
I continue to came across clickable video tweets which after click continue to play video in top half of the screen while in bottom part of the screen loading a web page. Almost all of these tweets are NSFW so I guess they are not created with XAds. Is there any third party tool that can do this?

Topic: I see some of those on Facebook and it's likely not third party, but built in as a service on the platform itself. Not entirely sure about Twitter's version though, I'd say it's likely a Twitter feature for certain ads.

Hey there! Have you tried looking into third-party tools for creating that kind of content?
