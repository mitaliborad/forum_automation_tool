Got a link in my bio to one of my domains/sites. I post daily videos/pics highlighting a model of the cam site.

I also follow/unfollow around 100 accounts per day automatically and retweet, comment and like a bunch of posts in my timeline.

Just copy what others do, I’ll give you a hint - search for keywords like “chudai” or “bokep” and work from there: aged accs, 14+ days warmup if you do posting, buy a blue if you do commenting.

Also think of how you can get the traffic, there are different ways with different approaches: posting, commenting, actions (follow, like, mention, dm).

Reverse engineering is the key
What I am doing rn: Twitter Spam and Parasite SEO
What I am good at: Python, Reverse Engineering, Data Analytics, Media Buying (Pop mostly)

Please send me a pm if you are able to help!

Topic: I'm sure there's plenty. Though I imagine the real money promoting that on Twitter is to redirect users towards a platform you already post your content on. Though heads up because Twitter prefers to keep its users in its own platform, but there's ways around that hurdle.
