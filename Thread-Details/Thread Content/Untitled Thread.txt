Topic: I had a myspace account years ago when they used to allow people to pimp out their pages.
Once they didn't allow that anymore, and insisted on revamping their website all the time,
(while destroying everyone's hard work in the process), they lost their audience and facebook crushed them.
I'm surprised they even still exist!
