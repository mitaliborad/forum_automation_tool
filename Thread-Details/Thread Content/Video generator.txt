Topic: So. I have a yt channel whwre i upload 8-12hr asmr type videos. Like rain etc.
Is there any video generator where i could make this from prompts?
Rn what im doing is im using ai to generate a cozy pic and just edit the looping sound by hand and render it.
But it takes so much time to render these out...
Any help?

8–12 hours??? Is this a contestant for the Guinness Book of Records? Even the original rain stops after 3–5 hours, yet your video keeps running...

Topic: Still looking. PromptBase is literally just people selling prompts for ai sites to create stuff. Nice its fine. But most of the sites are really not on the cheap side!
I dont mind a 10$ monthly payment for something like this but the fact that how limited 10$ is at these sites is just mind buggling to me.
ArtGuru only generates pictures sadly.
I know i wrote i generate pics but what i ment was videos basically. If we wanna stay at the rain category. Vids where the rain constantly falls. Not jsut a stable image.
