Topic: Need an AI-powered video creation tool that combines advanced automation with the flexibility for manual adjustments.

Tool should allow users to make fine-tuned edits to even the smallest details of the video, such as timing, transitions, and effects. Additionally, the AI should be capable of generating realistic emotions and expressions in characters, ensuring that the video feels natural and engaging.

The tool should also include high-quality audio generation that matches the emotional tone and context of the video, creating a seamless and immersive viewing experience.


Let me know any one know .I'll buy it

Topic: Long answer short: There's isn't a single one that can do what you ask in one suite (and most probably would never be)

Long answer: for all of the aspects you mention, you'll need three or more suits to develop the work. and have an standarized Process so eventually become's really manual and simple to work.

If you want to create a character, you can search for any "avatar" website to create a video of a talking person and then generates an audio with a clip.
If you want the best quality, adn you don't have enough computational power for it, you'll have to pau for services in creating images/video/ audio and lipsync. And then shove all of that into Capcut/premiere and work on it.

But the things you mention you want, doesn't exist in a single suite, and if it does, Is really, really bad, since these people must use a backend on comfyUI with outdates nodes and stuff with the most basic elements and stuff around to cut up cost of computational power.

There are lots of ai's that people are using if you just study their videos first. Some of them talk about the tools they use in the description. What you want though is impossible, and its lazy. What was your favorite movie in the cinema that moved you? Was it ai made? No, it took years and millions in budget! lol

But I suppose you can keep dreaming for your magical 1 click money making machine. No harm in wasting years of your life waiting for one though.
