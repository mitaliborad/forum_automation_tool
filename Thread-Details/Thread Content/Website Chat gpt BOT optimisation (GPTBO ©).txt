Topic: Probably many webmasters have noticed traffic from AI services on their sites: openAI, perplexity. What can be done to increase this traffic?
1. Allow in robots.txt
2. Structured scheme data
3. Something else?

Maybe there are some instructions and gray methods to interest AI bots?

Yes, I see more and more high-quality traffic from openai in the analytics. And I did nothing for this. I think if something is done, then traffic can be increased several times.
