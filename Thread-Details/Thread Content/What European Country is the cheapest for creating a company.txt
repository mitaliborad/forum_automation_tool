You can also check Ireland. It's not the cheapest option, but still affordable

Do you mean EU or Europe?

Creating a company is not the last word, keep that in mind,

Do you need a nomine director, share holders, UBOs etc, what are the maintenance fees, post forwarding etc.

Best and easiest imo is a UK LTD, but good luck getting a bank account with that.

Youll be registered for trading within days for some 2-300 quid, Malta and Cyprus are 5 to 10 times more expensive, it all depends on your needs.
