What do you think of xing.com

Topic User: r1ch11r1ch
Topic: As there are not many threads about the site, I thought I start one.
As someone that comes from Austria it looks quite promising, because xing.com is mainly used in the DACH area (Austria, Germany, Switzerland).
According to wikipedia they have 22m users from the DACH area.

I wonder what you guys think of it in terms of generating traffic, leads or employees?
