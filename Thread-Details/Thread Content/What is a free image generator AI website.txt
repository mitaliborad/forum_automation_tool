I'm also looking for a website like that. I can pay a fee. Most of them usually refuse to generate images for me because the content is related to nudity.

Topic: We all need this at some point, the best solution that i found was to get a software to do it, it's not free like the platform but at least it allows me to control and generate the images

I think there will be an app that can do this. The website can be quite strict and Ai will not support issues related to nudity on the web

I've tried using it, but it's for chatting, not for generating images from text.

Dall-E doesn't allow the generation of nude images, Midjourney is no longer free. I can't apply anything from your advice.
