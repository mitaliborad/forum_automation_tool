Topic: MySpace was a social media platform like Facebook. Was very popular untill Facebook took over its user base and traffic.
Benefits? It gives a nofollow profile backlink but I doubt even that is of any benefit anymore.

Topic: MySpace has become more focused on music. So one can say if you are into music niche, then it may help .... But not sure about its statistics. When I was on MySpace, it was a happening place, but couldn't stand to the Social Network Wave ....
