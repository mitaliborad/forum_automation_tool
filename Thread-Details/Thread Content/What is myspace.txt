People evolved and no longer live in caves or get around by jumping from one branch to another just to get a banana.

Hmmm, I saw programmers in a job jumping from one github branch to another github branch. And after few jumps they'd eat a banana.

Topic: @lucky.sparks you have an opportunity to get 8 million simple minded users. Similar to Omegle by numbers. Maybe lower. Their audience qualifies as "cavemen". Can you still make money off caveman?

omegle had 60m reported by similarweb, so if myspace has 8m reported by same metrics while I'm sure it doesn't show the real count of people visiting, it would show the scale of how smaller the userbase is.

i would go for discord automation instead, where similarweb reports 1B.

edit: looks like similarweb reports myspace to be around 2.5m, so it's pretty useless in bigger scale.

I'm sure more generic offers could still be sold there, e.g. something in evergreen niche that isn't gender specific. for example: earning money guides.

I'd argue that it's still a network, but lost the "social" part.
Although I'm not one to judge someone for wanting to socialize only with themselves.

I miss my MySpace, lost tons of music I made in my teen years that was uploaded there.
