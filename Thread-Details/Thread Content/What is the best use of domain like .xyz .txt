Topic: - install a URL shortening service on it and use it to shorten your URLs when you need
- use it as a portfolio type of website for your fun projects / hobbies / crazy activities / whatever
- use it as a churn & burn project (if you don't care about it populate it with millions of AI articles and blast it with millions of shitty links until it either ranks or expires)
- put a BIG "donate" button in the middle of the homepage and a trolling message beneath the button, that says "donate to me because my site is cool"

Use it on social media platforms if your previous domains are blacklisted for spamming.

Topic: I'm running a niche site on an xyz domain, and so far, haven't experienced any issues. The site is growing normally like any other TLD.

Not sure if I'll have any issues in the future because of this, but so far so good.

Topic: In My Opinion, I think it's best used for spamming. Using it as a business/brand domain will make you look unprofessional and no will take you serious.

I can't even use it for redirect.
