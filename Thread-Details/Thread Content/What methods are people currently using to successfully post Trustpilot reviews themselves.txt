Topic: What methods are people currently using to successfully post Trustpilot reviews themselves? I've tried using setups like GoLogin or ADSPower combined with Smartproxy or Oxylabs, but none of them worked—my reviews still ended up being removed.
For the proxy part, I purchased residential proxies.

If anyone is willing to share their method with me, I’d be happy to pay for it. Just leave your contact details and let me know how you managed to do it.

A few days ago, out of curiosity, I bought two Trustpilot reviews from sellers. But I noticed they were both made using newly registered accounts, and the reviews were posted immediately after registration. Since then, I’ve been testing various antidetect browsers and proxy setups, but I still haven’t found a method that actually works without getting flagged.
