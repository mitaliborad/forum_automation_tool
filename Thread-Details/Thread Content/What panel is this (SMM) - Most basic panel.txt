It looks good but what's driving me crazy is that every panel has a "Child Panel" that costs 20$ but if I want to get it from PerfectPanel its 50$?

Child panel allows you to only resell stuff from the panel you ordered child panel from.
Perfect Panel is open for your software, servers, many exchange websites API, other panels etc... not only 1.

Perfect is just a management / API layer – I'm looking for an exchange site along the lines of what @SpawneR mentioned.
