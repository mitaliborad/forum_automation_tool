Topic: Hi guys,

I own one of the most active adult content pages on X (specifically feet pics) and I have been reached out by a company that has a website dedicated to selling feet. They want me to promote their website for one month to test how it goes. My posts get between 600-1.5k likes and over 100k views. They want to pay me $750 for the one month of me promoting their site (2x posts per week so 8 posts total).

Does this sound like a fair trade? What I know is I will bring more traffic to their website but not sure if what they are offering me is fair? I'm not desperate for money so please give me your thoughts on this if you've been through similar situations.

Thank you

considering your engagement and reach, you might be able to negotiate a better deal, especially if they profit significantly from the traffic you send. You could ask for a performance-based bonus (like a commission per sale) or a higher flat rate if they see good results. If you're not in a rush, maybe test with a shorter campaign first to gauge their actual returns before committing to a full month.

This is solid advice thank you! I can do a trial run with them like you suggested, maybe 3-5 days. My only worry is that I know they will gain at least 2k new users on their site and they may feel that is enough and not want to offer me something that's fair?

Their website is approved by Twitter (their account has over 100k followers) and the link they want me to use is already in their bio so that's not something I am worried about. It's a legit site I personally used in the past

Yes feet pics, women that sell feet pics use that website to sell used items and feet pics

I did ask for more but he was hesitant and said he'd need to discuss it with his business partner

Try to ask for at least $1200-$1400 for a monthly promotion including 8 posts

Wow okay, thank you for your opinion on this. I will give them a test run and then go from there I appreciate it!

Thank you for your advice on this. I felt it was very low too so I will re negotiate by offering one day first to show what I can bring
