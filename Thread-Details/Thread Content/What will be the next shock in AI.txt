I asked chatgpt your question and this is it’s respond
2025: AI becomes sentient and starts asking us existential questions like, "Why did the chicken cross the road? And more importantly, why are we here?" Get ready for philosophical debates with your friendly neighborhood AI!

Great joke. Apart from that I don't see A.I. becoming sentient any time soon. If someone tries and makes A.I. sentient it will be the death of us all!

Topic: SORA is shock? For me it's useless.

But to each their own.

Next shocking thing will be Sora but in actually useful version for video editing my footage.

For now, all mediocre prototypes.

Joke. Quality is fine. Usefulness zero

Topic: We still have lots of work to improve LLMs, I can say for Claude: hallucinations, image recognition, data analysis, PDFs...
Anything else lacks reality for the next decade.
