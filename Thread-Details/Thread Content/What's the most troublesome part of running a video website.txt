Topic: Lately, I've been struggling with a few projects related to video websites. I thought picking a reliable storage solution would be enough – turns out, there are so many issues to deal with: speed, ad management, stability, and even SEO for content.
For those who have set up video sites before, what part did you find the most "headache-inducing"? Any real-life tips to avoid going through the trial-and-error process?
I’d love to hear some insights from you all. Thanks a lot!

Topic: Managed a porntube. The biggedtt issue was monetising and DMCA.

I didn't store anything, I just embedded content from other sites. Still got hundreds of automated DMCA requests and got delisted by Google.

So traffic became an issue. Being dependent mostly on seo in this niche can be a death trap.

Topic: With video sites that self host (not embed) the struggle is usually scaling - you can't host too much content that doesn't generate enough revenue. You need to monitor content and remove stuff that don't make sense. Going from a one server set up to a busy site is not an easy task, because you usually need to re-do the whole infrastructure set up.

Yeah, that's been giving me a headache for the past few days.

Do not give up. Handle each problem one by one. Once you have solved each problem, you will be in position to start more of similar projects.

Yeah, Thanks for your feedback. I will try to find more solutions to see if they are more feasible.
Are you also running a video website now?

That seems very annoying. Why would you get dmca notice when you are picking videos from api. Thats weird.
May be those were fake dmca notices?
