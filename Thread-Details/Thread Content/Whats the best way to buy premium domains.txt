Besides the big marketplaces like Sedo, Flippa, and Afternic, you can check NameLiquidate or DNWE for hidden gems. If a domain isn’t listed, you can try contacting the owner through WHOIS lookup (if available) or via their website/contact page. Some brokers also help with negotiations. Have you tried reaching out directly?

I havnt emailed anyone. Most of the domains I like has no website and no info in whois. I think I have to go via broker route.
