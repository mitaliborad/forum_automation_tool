Where Can I register Domain without KYC?

Topic: Hey guys!

my domain name (that's been registered with Namesilo) is up for renewal soon and I tried to renew it manually and - for the first time since I've used Namesilo (over 10 years now) - I was asked to enter in billing address and phone number which - as you all know by now - I HATE it! It's no one's business where I live or what my phone number is.... not to mention that I might not even have a phone to begin with (I do, but let's pretend that I don't ) so what then? I wouldn't be able to own a domain name just because I don't have a phone? That's stupid... well, I know about the "own nothing and be happy" agenda, but still....

Anyway, it's time for me to finally part ways with Namesilo so I need a domain registrar that's not so nosy, so can you recommend something?

When I tried to renew this domain in Namesilo I tried both the Credit Card option (which asked me for my address), but also I tried Paypal (which is what I used to use mostly when buying stuff online), but Paypal won't allow me to renew unless I enter in a phone number, so I guess it's time to part ways with PP too....

I know that the alternatives nowadays seem to be Porkbun and Spaceship / Namecheap, but I don't trust Namecheap and all of their other businesses (like Spaceship) because they've screwed me before, so I'd like to avoid them...

As for Porkbun, I don't know, I never used them before, and I wouldn't mind trying them out if - through some miracle - they managed to slip through the sausage fingers of the totalitarian oligarchs that rule this world, and not require KYC. But I don't know if that's the case, so those who use Porkbun, do let me know!

Besides Porkbun, what other domain registrar do you guys know of that lets me renew my measly $5 domain without wanting to know who I am, where I live, what I had for breakfast, the consistency of my poop, and wanting to take my DNA and blood samples? Any normal registrar left out there, or are they all compromised?

you didn't see this answer coming, but.... I didn't think of it because when I saw the "enter billing address" field I got triggered and enraged and I couldn't think properly

and number?
with Paypal it won't work because I'm not allowed to access my account until I give them my phone number so they can send me SMS (for my own safety and protection, of course, why would you assume that a mafia company wants my data? it's always about my safety and protection)

I need to transfer and renew, not register. But like I said, I have been screwed by Namecheap in the past, so I'm not doing business with scumbags again.

Thanks for the suggestion, though!

did you try to renew your domains in the last month?

Also, I don't use crypto, so that's not an option for me

Topic: A fake address would work, unless you need the receipt for tax deduction (I assume that the sum could be disposable in exchange for the privacy you're after).
Phone number is a bit tougher, and you really don't want to not own a phone number thag is linked to your PP..
If I were you, I'd buy a new number just for these and keep it.
Do you have the option to "own" a disposable number in your country?

come on, guys, I don't / won't use Namecheap and I literally asked for alternatives to Namecheap and Porkbun, why do you keep recommending Namecheap?

no idea what you mean by "disposable number". Is this one of those top-up SIM cards that give you a number and you can pay $5 or $10 to top it up with credit?

Regardless, I'm not getting another phone number when I barely use the current one. And my phone is not dual-sim either, so I'd have to buy a new phone, and if I have to do this I'd be better off not bothering with any of these to begin with.

Anyway, thanks for your suggestions, folks! I am a bit disappointed that you all recommend the same crooks (Namecheap), but I'm also encouraged to try giving them a fake address as I did in the past (hopefully, it still works).... although I'd still like to move away from Namesilo. Every company that grows big starts acting monopolistically, so I'd like to give smaller guys a chance....

I go try to use fake address, brb...

EDIT: well blimey! It worked
