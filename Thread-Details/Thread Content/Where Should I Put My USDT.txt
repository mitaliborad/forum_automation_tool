Honestly, if I had invested in ADA, I could have gotten a 100X return, it reached 0.6450 to 1.1488
and BTW 100X I meant 100% haha my bad If I did not write that correctly.

ADA is up 60% today because POTUS said it will be included in the US strategic crypto reserve, you can't really predict these news.

Topic: Look for early-stage projects with strong narratives (AI, DeFi, RWA, L1s, and GameFi). Always research before investing and don't invest all your funds in one project.

Crypto indexes underperformed Bitcoin in 2024. Expect a 50%+ drop in 2025. Crypto winter's coming, not the best time to invest.

If that's what you meant, SOL would be the safe option to invest in.

So you want guaranteed 300x in one year? If anyone knew this, they would have taken as much loan as possible and put all in it. Remember that there is lot of risk with crypto investment. Your 3000 dollars can also become zero.

Topic: Aiming for 100-300X is unrealistic. You can still go for SOL and some established coins. Diversification is the best to balance risk and remember to DYOR.

You are wrong
100x don't mean 100%
100X means that you get your investment x100
100% is just 1X
So you just want to double that or triple it so you mean 2X-3X

Topic: 2X-3X is not impossible at all, you can invest in some large coins in relevant narratives such as RENDER, NEAR or FET, those are AI coins and I'm very optimistic about the possibilities that all those coins will strongly value this year

You're looking for 300X returns? Have you ever done a 50X?

Topic: Expecting 100-300X returns is extremely risky, especially in crypto, where volatility can wipe out gains fast. Only a few small projects ever reach that level, and timing the market is nearly impossible
