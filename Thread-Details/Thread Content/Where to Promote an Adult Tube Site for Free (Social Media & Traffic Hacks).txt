Where to Promote an Adult Tube Site for Free? (Social Media & Traffic Hacks)

Topic User: The Websiter
Topic: Hey BHW,

I just launched an adult tube site with licensed content, and we’re looking for the best ways to promote it for free using social media, forums, and other traffic sources. We have ads running on the site, and we’ll be adding memberships soon, so traffic that converts is the goal.

We haven’t set up social media accounts yet, so we want to know: Which platforms actually work for adult traffic in 2025?

What I Need Help With:
Best social media platforms to post adult content without bans
Hidden traffic sources beyond just Reddit & Twitter
How to leverage TikTok, Telegram, or other platforms for traffic without getting accounts nuked
SEO strategies for long-term traffic growth
Paid traffic options that are actually worth it
How to collab with other adult creators for exposure
Automation tools or bots (if any) that can help scale this up

If you’ve successfully promoted an adult tube site before, drop your best strategies below. I’m open to black-hat & gray-hat techniques as long as they work.

What’s working in 2025? Let’s discuss!

Topic: Promoting adult websites nowadays is tricky. I've tried several platforms, but X (Twitter) and Reddit are the most effective. I can't say much since I don’t know what your content is about, but if you find a good subreddit to post in and create a viral X account, you can generate a significant amount of free traffic. However, this is rare nowadays—X shadowbans most accounts, and many subreddits have strict moderators.

Your best bet is organic traffic. Focus on SEO, link building, and improving your content. This will be a far better use of your time than searching for so-called "hidden traffic sources."

Topic: On X you can have this interaction very well, Reddit is a mixed platform (in my opinion) but X is really active. Your posts are much more in front of people. I have a service for this, you can message me for more details. In addition, I am happy to help you not only for trade but also for free

edit: I'm running an A/B test to determine the actual target audience for this content, contact me if you're interested in the results. I can let you know when it's done
