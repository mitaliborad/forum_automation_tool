try tools like midjourney or dreambooth, for creating ultra realistic, consistent ai models based on your specific needs.

Topic: I think flux, midjourney and stable diffusion are some of the best, oh yeah grok as well

but lately I've played with the latest AI from open ai and it does really well

for example, I gave open ai the first prompt that popped in my mind (simple prompt just: make an image of a cat riding a bike while sniffing cat nip from a jar labeled berserker juice) and this is what I got, with a bit more effort no doubt it will look much better

Topic: Definitely midjourney with the right prompting. GPT's new updated Dall-e is getting really good (again, with the right prompting techniques) Also, I'd tell you to check out imagefx by google. It's in beta in Google Labs. You might have to join a waitlist still. I'm not sure. I doubt most have heard of it but I've been beta testing for google and microsoft in the ai space for around 3 years now. It's been a heck of a ride. Check that one out though. Goodluck.
