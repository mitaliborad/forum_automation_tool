Topic: I need a lot of Twitter followers frequently and used already multiple panels with mixed succes

JAP, pacysmm, socialpanel24, smmpasa, dripfeedpanel, fivebbc, bestsmmprovider, realsite - to name a few

all of them can't deliver their promises, drops, bad support, pending orders are nothing special

I also had orders filled on time but you can't rely on them, today it works tomorrow will not even if you buy the most expensive orders they offer

From few days after last Twitter update there are massive problems with Twitter followers, from what I see there is no single service that can deliver stable followers right now, all i bought in last 3 days from multiple services (advertised on this forum) dropped already, despite I always buy only the most expensive orders with refill guarantee

so what are you using right now to get Twitter followers? any luck?

share your experience please, like this we will be able to figure out where to look to get Twitter followers today

Topic: Most of them use same provider and in the end it doesn't matter where you buy from, you will get same bad results. Be it Twitter, Instagram or anything else.

Most efficient way of getting followers is through Follow/Unfollow or posting good content and interacting with others.

Topic: I think we should share info about them to figure out what works and not

finally this is forum and we should benefit from that, not the other way around

now this is hub for them to advertise and scam us literally
I keep pumping many social media accounts but usually I work on Twitter

followers, likes, retweets, views - ONLY HQ (with guarantee)- this is what I look for

and in last days i used:

JAP - bought 20K package 70$ - they delivered fast in 24 hours but it dropped just after and until today (1 week) still not resolved, of course many replies "we are on this", "speeding up" and such BS

https://pacysmm.com/ - stable on HQ orders but delivery is low max 200 accounts a day, so big orders take ages to fill but from all of them this is the one most reliable when it comes to running bussines

https://realsite.shop - bought multiple orders all kinds of their highest quality and all dropped just after delivery, when ask for refill they will use "dropped below start count" or "this is old drop not ours" excuse

https://bestsmmprovider.com/ - same as above, all what was delivered dropped just after, refills are not respected never get one from, them, of course despite they say "we are on this", "refilling RN"

https://fivebbc.com/ - as for now bough only one order from them and of course dropped also, they say is old, will have to check more orders to be sure if this is also SMM service worth nothing

https://dripfeedpanel.com/ - first order delivered flawlessly, second order repeated just after the first finished is pending from 4 days, they speed it up everyday. keep ticketing every 24 hours...

https://smmpasa.com/ - total scam, no delivery no support, looks like total ripoff - WATCH OUT TOTAL SCAM!

https://socialpanel24.com/ - 2 orders delivered, 3rd same reorder pending from 2 days,
looks like there was some update on Twitter and all services struggle to get at least their followers orders filled

same problem everywhere, support says they will help but this is all they do, keep answering tickets to win another 24 hours because they know we are in hurry and need to deliver fast, if not client will be not happy, so this waiting game works, no sense to ticket them more then once, if not refilled after no sense to bother at all, buy new one or look for another service because it wont be refilled ever

Looks like there are few main hubs from where all these child panels are created, and indeed if you have them all and nothing works, then nothing works and is better to wait

Tbh unless you waited at least 30 days in-between orders or used a different Twitter account, what you are doing makes it impossible for any smm panels to service you since your stacking services.

It's impossible for them to determine who's service are dropping.

oh common

they can track their shit don't they, there are panels that will show you reports when they need to prove the drop is not theirs of course, they can see what is delivered and what is dropped and if it is theirs

if they can't then this is for sure shitty service

Not how it works. You sound like a troll.

You can't determine which followers are from who and who's panels followers dropped.

I'm not a fan of the smm services on here, but how your doing your analysis is wrong.

There's a reason why I gave up on doing a thread like this, it would take years to test everyone's services.

You cant buy thousands of twitter followers within a week from multiple providers and expect to determine which drops are from who.

I agree most of those are crap providers but the way your doing it is wrong.

I don't think I sound like troll

why I am doing this wrong, why you assume that? you don't know the details, and believe me I have a lot of experience, am doing this from 2 years every single day

yes it is clearly visible which drops are where, nobody orders to one account at the same time from few services, happened of course but intentionally

just to update

as for now my best luck was with: https://socialpanel24.com/

they delivered, folowers are stable as for now, and their support also work ok,

of course there was some speed problems but overall they are the best in last few days

looks like another child panel, you will find the same followers cheaper in services I provided in opening post

do I recommend them, of course not

but there is nothing else to choose from, they all sell that same orders, looks like there are few main providers and all the rest are child panels

it is pretty easy to see because they have similar website design/templates also they are lazy and copy orders and descriptions word by word, so just compare it, look at prices and find the cheapest one, the cheaper you have the closer you are to the source

smmorigins
yes I have used them and agree that seller is reliable, only not for me they offer only one kind of followers 9$ for 1000 of them, and all will be ok if the quality and speed will be good and they are able to deliver only 500 followers max a day which is waaay to less for me

thank you haven't tried them and for sure I will

with start speed is not so bad, if they start in 12-24 hours and deliver, I am already so disappointed with all other services that such long start times are nothing for me

Looks like we are closer to the source in this case, I know similar orders form order panels and they ask more for them, so we are here one childpanel higher LOL

I will update how it goes


as for now only https://socialpanel24.com/ delivers, don't want to compliment them too much too early, opened 4th order, and waiting to be filled

As for now I am sure that https://socialpanel24.com should also be avoided

same problem, after drop ticket game starts, they will do all what possible to not refill or refund

Twitter followers don't work anywhere. Who's ever providing them to everyone is either doing it wrong and getting them banned or is unfollowing with them shortly after to reduce bans.

no this is not true, I myself bought followers for many account and when I check a lot of them is still there but I agree that situation is getting worse with each day, I think Twitter is implementing update after update and they just can't deliver

unfortunately they keep offering same followers as usual despite they know it wont be delivered, still there are few that keep providing HQ, biggest problem it is not enough, they can only provide max few thousand HQ followers daily combined

low or medium quality has totally no sense it will drop sooner or later and this will be rather sooner then later

don't give up and keep trying, if you have found something share it here

as for now I had my best luck with: FortuneSmm

and bigger scammer from last week is JAP - yes old service that should be the best from all, they took my 70$ for 20K package and delivered nothing, after ticket and refill request of course they gone silent for days, after many tickets with no reply i finally bought followers by ForuneSMM, they delivered and guess what JAP send me an answer to ticket then saying "we have refilled your order, enjoy"

WHAT A FUCKING SCAMMERS JAP (justanotherpanel) - AVOID!!!

I had 7$ left so I bought another order is processing from 5 days but even single follower was not delivered

JAP is a total ripoff right now, they will take your money and deliver nothing, only fake promises and support that plays waiting game. JAP SHOULD BE ADD TO SCAMS - .

None of Twitter followers have worked within the last 30-45 days. JAP is already been banned on here.
