Topic: More and more AI video generators are getting regulated. Yeah, I'm talking about generatorss like Kling and Hailuo. They used to be really flexible. You know, there was this unrestricted freedom where you could do all sorts of things without getting restricted. But what about now? Look at what they've become. Not only is the generation speed unacceptable, but the content filtering also seems to be getting stricter and stricter. Is there any AI video generator that can turn pictures into videos without restrictions? Can anyone recommend one?

Topic: also,The generation effect controlled by text is really bad. I believe AI img2video should be able to get better results. Keyframes play a huge role.

Topic: One of the best AI generators for turning photos into videos, with minimal or no filtering, is Deep Nostalgia by MyHeritage. It animates still photos to create short, lifelike video clips. Another option is Runway ML, which offers advanced AI tools for generating videos from images without heavy filtering. Both tools are user-friendly and produce impressive results with minimal manipulation.

Thanks for the recommendation. I used Myheritage a few years ago. Back then, its functions were pretty limited. It was like making a photo “sing” or something. I can't quite remember clearly. I haven't used it for ages, but I might give it a try.

Their generation results are quite good. But you know, since December, their risk control has become much stricter. That will put a lot of restrictions on creation, you know that

Topic: Legendary Jewish celebrities tell Kanye West to F-off.

In an AI-generated video, Jewish celebrities - from Scarlett Johansson to Adam Sandler - give Kanye the middle finger.

This video is a direct rejection of the rapper’s antisemitism.

Topic: Well you need to get smarter with prompting, don't use any words that could trigger the filters, people are still doing some hardcore stuff on there. Your other option is it to use a local model, but you most likely need to rent GPU for that, as they do have some crazy requirements. Anything other online and uncensored like PixVerse doesn't have the best quality.

Topic: Indeed, many AI video generation tools (like Kling and Hailuo) are now tightening content review and restrictions, and the speed has also slowed down. This change has frustrated many creators, especially in the past when they could play freely.

I heard that Wan Video has quite good NSFW capabilities. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to get any results so far.

I think I made a mistake. I saw that it was marked on their website that it's still in the beta period. So I think that's the reason why some people can't see it. Maybe they are conducting tests. Who knows?

I can see this feature, but it requires payment. How the effect of "Image to video" is? Do I just need to upload an image to convert it into a video? I wonder if I can use this feature to make money on OF.
