Topic: So goodbye and good riddance to MySpace. Well, not ?good riddance,? exactly, because the service was sold and its new owners (an online ad agency named ?Specific Media? and Justin Timberlake) do intend to shock MySpace back into sinus rhythm, likely by refocusing it on its early successes as a platform for independent musicians. But its days as a player in conventional social networking are really most sincerely dead.

Topic: I still have it, but I go on it like once every 2 months or so, to see what bands are up to. I never used it for actual friends, but rather an easy way (as well as Twitter) to see what celebs are up to, and when tickets are coming out etc.

Topic: I never had a myspace back when it was cool. You could customize your page any way you wanted. I remember it was really popular but went to shit really fast.

Topic: I had a Myspace account back in 2006, and I even logged on once in a while after that to read old messages, but then when the new Myspace was released, I couldn't log into my account any more. So no, I do not have a Myspace now.

Topic: I cannot even believe the forum still has a Myspace section since it is a dead marketing tool.

Topic: I have loads of accounts with millions of friends from my days of running a really big site that gave free layouts/pics etc. Got in early and made a killing. I still make a few bucks with them just by posting offers but it's just a small sideline now.
