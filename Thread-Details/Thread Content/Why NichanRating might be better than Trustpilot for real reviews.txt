Why NichanRating might be better than Trustpilot for real reviews?

Topic: I've been using different review platforms, and I recently came across NichanRating. It seems to offer more features than Trustpilot, like proof of payment verification, live ratings, and a reward system for reviewers.

Trustpilot has been around for a long time, but there are always complaints about fake reviews and companies manipulating ratings.

Has anyone here tried NichanRating? How does it compare to Trustpilot in terms of reliability and fairness?

Topic: NichanRating seems promising with its verification features, but Trustpilot remains more established. Reliability depends on user experience and platform transparency.
