Why are people saying blogging is dead and to give up?

Topic: So lately I've been seeing lots of people on here saying to either quit blogging or not start at all.

I understand it's extremely hard to compete against the giants and to rank for certain niche topics since the google update, but is blogging dead?

ngl its slightly tilting haha, I'm making this post to get some insight into anything I may be missing?

I have a great niche which I've already started ranking for and slowly gaining topical authority, it is indeed a very slow start but I also market it through a social media page with 60k+ followers (organic) which generates good traffic.

Why is blogging dead?

Thanks

Thanks!

As I always say, the people who disagree are link sellers (they are always the first to jump in and defend and mock others), and the people who aren't affected yet... Usually new players in the field.
Once you've been in this line for a decade or so, you will see a totally different story.

Most importantly, even if you aren't affected by the algorithms or you can game it successfully all the way, do remember that Google sees organic sites as 'parasites' and they want to decrease visibility to it.

Why do you think Google is always shoving ads and unnecessary elements to the search results layout? 4 Paid ads at the top; "People Also Asked"; "Videos" panel; "Images" panel; Shopping Ads panel, "People Also Searched For"; and so on.
The more competitive or valuable the keyword is, the more Google will shove these elements in the search results. This is particularly true for any buyer intent or commercial keywords.

And just when you guys think things won't get bad enough:

Google is now showing a 5th ad panel on the search results.

And Google will just keep getting worse.... Believe me. Users are leaving enmasse to other search engines or AI chatbots like ChatGPT. And Google still has ad revenues to hit every quarter and it keeps getting crazier due to their greed during COVID times. Now they are struggling to keep it up while also faced with users leaving in droves (see graph: https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share#monthly-202303-202404). This 5th ad just dropped this month... What about the months or years ahead? I believe it will just keep getting worse. That is why when I say "SEO is dead"... it isn't just the lousy algorithm updates; but also how Google is killing organic traffic with all these elements and despicable 'methods' to reduce organic sites visibility.

Well, blogging is not dead, but it's getting harder and harder to make money. Google Adsense is getting harder to get approved + with the introduction of AI is flooding the blogging websites.
If you have the right niche, it can still be profitable.

Topic: As with anything online, It's all about a return on investment. (ROI)

New niche blogs/websites have at best a 50/50 chance of success.

Years of work, a large investment of time and money, with no guarantee of a decent return.

More akin to gambling, that a career choice.

The speed at which the digital world is changing, means no one can predict what SEO will look like next year, let alone long term.

Thank you for an indepth response, I'm gonna look at the links you shared, what your saying does make sense. My only question is why does google see organic sites as parasites?

YouTube is a search engine easiest to rank in. Now nobody cares. Ahahah reaaski spoils the traffic source again yet competiton doesn't rise!

They will check competition at fake tools made by Russian propagandists and never touch it. Now they're gonna focus 0 comp keywords on ahrefs and never rank. Because YouTube tools will always show competition higher than 0, they will always choose Google.

That psychology lool. Whoever created these tools and that propaganda surrounding them must have been an intellectual mastermind to kill competition!

These keyword difficulty statistics are so all over the place it can be easily called manipulation. Whether it's intended or not. It's still pure lies.

So try v-logging instead of b-logging.

You'll always have that personal touch and unique personal brand with vlogging and video while with blogging it's not so easy to get personal touch. So it's one thing off long list of checkmarks

It's weird if your videos don't get views. With blogging it's weird if posts actually get views.
