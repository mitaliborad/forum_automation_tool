Topic: Usually they buy aged accounts, it saves them creating them for themselves. If your operation is big, eventually you'll want to create them yourself but it's good to start with bought accounts

Because old Instagram accounts have higher credibility, they are less likely to be scanned when they use them to grow their channels. Having an old account already means they don't have to spend time building their channels.
In addition, some people also use it to increase interactions for their main accounts.

Because to build a new account, they will spend a lot of effort and time. The old account can be used to make money right away, they just want to save their time and effort.
The new account has the ability to not build a reputation and has no transaction history, if used to make money, it is easy to be noticed by the server.
