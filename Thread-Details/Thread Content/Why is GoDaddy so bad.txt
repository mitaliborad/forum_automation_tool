Why is GoDaddy so bad?

Topic: I see so many people here saying GoDaddy isn't good, transfer it away from GoDaddy, and buy your domain from everywhere else except GoDaddy.

I have bought ~50 domains on GoDaddy in the last few years and honestly love it. I don't understand where all the hate is coming from and wonder if there is something I should know that makes it so terrible.

I get almost all of my .com domains for 3 years for $44. Have I been overpaying all this time? Should I transfer them all somewhere else?

Topic: they're bad because they're owned by "business people" and business people (unlike real humans) only care about money and nothing else... only the law (when available) can force business people to stay honest, transparent or moral, otherwise business people have no morals and no empathy for humans and for life in general. They don't even identify with humans anymore, they only think and see life and humanity in terms of numbers and profits. The richer they are, the less empathetic and humane they become, I know this from first-hand experiences because I've lived for 40 years around them (my father had owned several construction companies and he's taken me many times to meetings with such people, there were also times when we've had our offices right beneath our house and I'd meet a lot of strange and weird folks that would come to us for business purposes and I'd have to entertain them for 30+ minutes until father would come back from his business trips, and during this time - being (humbly saying it) quite intelligent, but also overly sensitive and overly emotional for a man - I could see and feel those guests for what they are, and I noticed this thing that the richer they were / the bigger of a company they owned the colder, more calculated they were, they literally seemed soulless many times, I felt like they'd have no problem cutting your throat like a common thug and stealing all of your money if this current society weren't as favorable to them as it is, they'd genuinely show their true colours in a morals-based society)

Anyways, times are slowly changing and this parasitic species of "people" (the businessmen, the ones that worship money but don't know how to do anything of importance / care about, because they just know how to spot opportunities and make money) is slowly disappearing, but it will take a few more decades until we get rid of these weirdos...

But yeah, GoDaddy is probably owned by the same species of people, so they won't care about customers because they can't identify with them anymore, they've stayed rich and successful for so long that they've started feeling superior to us, the plebes and they've become self-entitled pricks, forgetting that it's we, the people, that have made them big and powerful in the first place (well, because we've been forced by the world we live in, but still). In a normal society (ie a society that doesn't worship paper and numbers, and which is based on true, real values like honesty, kindness, altruism, love and care for life and for the environment, etc) all of these business people would struggle immensely to adapt to a normal, civilized society, but in the current one they thrive because this society is designed to prioritize making money... But anyway, this is a discussion for another day...

The moral of the story is that - left to their own - companies will behave according to the principles and personality of their owners, and GoDaddy seems to be owned by people who have no problems stealing people's money

Personally, I have had issues with GoDaddy's twice (about 15-ish years ago) when I first used them...

I don't remember what the 2nd issue was (it's really a long time, and I've gone through so many scams that I forgot which scam was pulled by which company) but the one that I remember was when I was purchasing domain names, and I've added a couple of them to my shopping cart, I went through the various checkout steps (I think the 2 domain names should have cost me $16-17 back then as .coms were only $8 or so) and the shopping cart showed $16 right until I clicked on "purchase", or "pay now", or whatever the checkout completion button said, I don't remember. And right after I've clicked on "pay now" they've showed me a report with my purchase and I noticed that instead of $16 they have charged me over $20 because they have SNEAKINGLY added whois protection and other garbage services to my shopping cart that they've never mentioned anywhere while I was going through the checkout process. At no step have I even be presented with those add-ons, I just woke up that they've forcibly added them to my shopping cart while my Paypal account was being charged...

I think that nowadays they at least show you these add-ons, but, but that's how they did it back then. And please, don't come at me with "bro, it's just $5, move the fuck on" because I will reserve the right to tell you off if you side with criminals, because it's not about the $5 as much as is about morals and thievery. They are crooks and thieves at their core, they just don't do it all the time, of course, because this would put them out of business, but scamming is part of their business model for sure...

Anyway, that's my personal experience with them, but there have been numerous other people complaining on the forum about GoDaddy's malpractices, just look them up and you'll find all sorts of weird stuff that they do...

Oh, and speaking of scumbaggery, I just remembered... sometimes, when you look up a domain name (that you wish to purchase) using their search engine, and that domain can be registered at normal price (let's say $10). They show this price to you but if you don't buy the domain right there and then when it's only $10 per year, but instead you leave their site and come back later to complete the purchase, that domain will now cost $100 or $1000s because that domain has suddenly and automagically become premium in the few minutes or hours that you've been gone LOL.

Topic: Their customer service is terrible
That's the main reason why I left them. I don't contact CS often but the rare offchance I do, I don't want to be thrown in a loop of automated messages, constant dept transfers and "sorry, I can't help you" loop.
But besides that
If they do offer extremely cheap domains, or free ones, I will still grab them and transfer out when needed.

I hope my voice will be heard and maybe here on BHW is a psychiatrist who can explain me this godaddyfokkers paradox;
A company has the rudest policies in the industry , suppress their consumer where they can , doing censorship the US governments not allwed with their own policy (law correct me here if I wrong) but then have millions of consumers ?

He? It's paradox isn't it? Is not normal most people would say, I guess, right? Look this is the same with us here in europe (germany) since the plandemic; the country/state makes the law, you can make you own house for guests right? But the catch is, You may not circumvent, undermine or abuse the laws of the federal state/ state which is a crime or not?

The godaddyfokkers doing so much crime and the US government allows this all? They are really Human söavery masters I would say.

Dude it's not only their overpricing structure, ( that would be "normal" for some business crooks, yes) but their actions, their rudest policy all that is it, their censorship, it's crime I would say what they are doing. They suppress their consumers like real human slavery masters, my friend.
