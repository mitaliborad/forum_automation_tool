Topic: Hello. I've used tumblr in the past when adult was allowed to generate lot of traffic and $ (heh golden ages)
Now im testing it agan. Im creating blogs with good proxies, fingerprints etc. Uploading sexy spinned tik tok videos without adult tags and without any links. The blogs start to gain likes and followers then after 3 4 days are banned....
Deos anyone know what can be the problem.?

Topic: is it possible that this is an ip thing ? There's crazy porn in there without getting banned with so many likes. Also the funny thing is that all those deactivated accounts still have their content reblogged, so it cant be a content thing
