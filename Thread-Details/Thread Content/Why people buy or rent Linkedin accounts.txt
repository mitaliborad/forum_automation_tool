They are attempting to scam you by checking your connection. If you provide your real account information, you could end up trapped. Please be cautious and avoid being overly eager in these situations. Might be i m wrong but we never no

They use it for lead generation, so pretty much they outreach as many people as they can for a product sale/link building/service offer/spearfishing etc.

People rent/buy LinkedIn accounts for lead generation, outreach, job scraping, and brand promotion. Some use them to bypass limits or for credibility in networking. However, this may violate LinkedIn’s policies.

Topic: They used accounts for Lead Generation, Data Scraping and Research, and Marketing. They don't use their accounts as suspension of account will be soon so they don't want to loose their account.

Topic: Because they provide many products to many different users. Therefore, they need many accounts to serve each different audience, avoiding the situation where one account does too many things and is easily warned or banned. In general, it also depends on the purpose of the user.
