Want to scale this up without getting banned?

What's the current limit for X (Twitter) for a verified account?

For verified Twitter accounts, the following limit is around 400/day, and engagement can reach up to 1,000 actions/day. To scale safely:

1. Increase gradually (e.g., 100-150 follows/day).
2. Avoid bots and automation.
3. Focus on authentic engagement.

Stay within limits to avoid penalties.

What's the best way to do 200 follows per day and 200 engagements without automation?

Any recommendations for tools that can help make this process easier?

Topic: Try to slowly scale it up
If you are doing 80 per day, try 85 for three days
Then 90 for another three days
And keep increasing it until 150-200

getting conflicting opinions here it seems:
- opinion A: 200 follows per day is fine as long as gradually increasing to it
- opinion B: 200 follows per day is too risky, regardless of the ramping

Topic: 200 per day is risk, doesn't matter the ramping. From what I hear 150 is also risky so can't say I recommend that either. From experience though, 60 to 100 is just fine to make the activity appear organic.
