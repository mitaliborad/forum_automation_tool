Topic: never saw something like that, first time, that is really unfortunate but is weird the reason why if you use it to only receive payments, who knows what trigger it, and depend what the payment was for, also I know if the money comes from a kind of shady or reported payment source or place they immediately block the account receiving the money, so even if you are not doing nothing wrong is just because who sent the money is already flagged.

I used wise, but never had issues until now, I don't use anything crypto related or suspicious payment

Topic: Did you eventually find out why it got blocked? Also, the payment you received, was it from a wise recipient or through one of wise's bank accounts? I had what seemed like random issues with paypal,payoneer and cashapp in the past, but after close analysis was able to find that there was a reason, that could be avoided in the future.

They will not mention the reason(s), nor giving any hint.
OP, you should ask them if you can try to open a new account in a few months.
