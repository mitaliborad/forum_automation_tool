Topic: Everyone that does parasite SEO knows google sites and pulses are not working in any query thats not "best vegan and cruelty free dog toys for impotent chihuahuas". And even then... oh well. If you fall for the attention grab that's on you.

Anyway. What do you do? You go where the big guys go -> right now that is GlobeNewswire.com (went from mere 500k to 1.9m in traffic over 2 months) and it ranks well, really well. For actualy competitive queries.

Only PRs accepted (AP Style) - but that's easy enough. If you got a bit of money laying around, want to test an affiliate offer, this is the one to go to right now.

Examples: "Online Casino"



"NSFW AI"



"best testosterone booster"




Deccanherald still works too, especially for loan or crypto terms.

Let's see how long this one lasts.

It pretty much came out of nowhere right? And people say that Google are killing parasite SEO

Deccanherald has certainly been slept on - they've been doing well as a relatively inexpensive parasite since at least 2023.

Yea, only started to really gain traction in March. Also agree on Deccanherald, fairly cheap.

I mean they probably know. lol
One site down, another pops up. Just slap it on a subdomain (hello forbes), do it for another 3-4 months. Repeat. Name of the game.

If Google employees really have to dredge forums to find sites that their own algo is ranking for a ton of gambling-related terms then I'd say we're golden lads
