YouTube Automation: too good to be true!

Topic: My Facebook newsfeed is bombarded with posts about how amazing is "YouTube automation" and how you can make serious $$ by just uploading some AI generated content on YouTube.
After doing some research, I found out that the creator of those posts split to 2 categories:

1. YouTube Gurus: the ones that they will teach you how start few YouTube faceless channels and start generating up to 5 figures a month. However, in order to achieve that, you will need to buy their course
2. Video editors: the ones that you pay them some bucks per video (I was quoted for $30-70 per video) including SEO, so they can help you make up to 5 figures a month after a few months from starting.

The crazy thing I don't understand is when I ask these people "why don't you create those channels for yourself and start making huge money rather than asking few bucks per your course or video editing service", their answer is always vague.

Doing some math makes this looks as a total scam. Let's pick the video editors, if you pay them $50/video and say average number of videos per faceless channels is around 10 means they are going to make $500 from you but they will make you generate 5 figures a month. C'mon, why not doing it for yourself?

Note: I am not seeking advice on how to run successful YouTube channels, but my goal from this post is to raise awareness for people who might fall into some of these traps and waste their hardworking money.

Topic: Some YouTubers have successfully channels and they just record with cameras and don't have time to edit. So they give editors to edit for them.

Since the editor knows the channel is successful they charge premium and use that as a basis for other jobs

Topic: While this is true, for video editors, this is more like a kinda of a way to bring clients to him, they say that your video will reach millions of views etc...

Topic: You'll find gurus selling courses, useless software, and/or their services in any niche. It's the meta* industry of making money online.

Topic: I got your point, there are several people providing courses or services for videos, but I want to ask why can't we do it ourselves? I mean there are many Ai tools available that can help you create quality videos in minutes and you can have good success with those videos.
So if anyone have interest in doing YouTube automation then do it on your own.
