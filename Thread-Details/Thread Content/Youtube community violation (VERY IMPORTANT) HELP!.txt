Topic: Hello, I shared a video, the name of the video is "TikTok private accounts viewing". I did not directly explain how to do this in the content, I just mentioned a link and explained that they can learn how to do this from the site in the link. But YouTube still removed my video. Although others directly explain this in their content, their videos are not removed. Why and how are my videos removed? How can I overcome this?

Topic: It seems that some competitor(s) reported your video and Youtube slave labour flagged your video (or channel).
Remove that link from that video's description (or comment) and then appeal the community violation. If you get any success, then wait for around 5 days and add that link again.

Görünüşe göre bazı rakip(ler) videonuzu bildirmiş ve Youtube köle emeği videonuzu (veya kanalınızı) işaretlemiş.
O düzeni o videonun açıklamasından (veya yorumundan) ve daha sonra bölmeye itiraz edin. Herhangi bir başarı elde ederseniz, yaklaşık 5 gün bekleyin ve o süreyi tekrar ekleyin.
The video didn't get many views, I don't think my competitors would do this. Also, there is no link in the description, I even stated that the video was prepared in accordance with the community rules.

YT likely flagged your video for linking to content that violates their policies.

Topic: Honestly, YouTube's rules are kinda vague. Could be that link you mentioned flagged it, even if the content itself was vague.

Topic: The channel you are sharing videos on is probably new and has little content, try old channels with videos uploaded.

There are no new and few videos. It is an active channel with tens of thousands of subscribers and many videos.

Is that the link I mentioned in the video?
