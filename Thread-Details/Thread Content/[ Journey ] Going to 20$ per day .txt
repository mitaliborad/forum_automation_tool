[ Journey ] Going to 20$ per day ?

Topic User: godd.
Topic: Hello guys ! I would like to post here my journey and , if possible, to get some help from some more experienced people.

I started my CPA Marketing Journey 3 months ago, with MaxBounty. I chose to promote surveys because I thought that it would be easy to do so, and now I also think that.
I chose Facebook as the main promoting platform, and it goes pretty meh, that's why I think you could help me with some tips.
In these 3 months I made only 150$ with 70$ of it being made this month, which I think it's a pretty low earning and I would have a lot more potential.

My whole strategy is that.
I get the affiliate link of the offer and I create a landing page for it using Carrd. After that, I promote the offer on Facebook Groups with "Romanians in UK" (because I am from Romania). I post a text with some colorful background in lots of groups like this and I wait for people to comment to my posts and to ask me for details. After that, I tell them the details and I respond in a comment with the link to the Landing Page. Here is the problem. I really don't know why all my account get restricted or banned, even if I share every post and send every comment at around 2 minutes from each other. All the restrictions and bans are for spamming. I tried to buy some more accounts, but it is the same situation, all of them end being banned.

1. Is there any method to promote these surveys offers on Facebook with free traffic, without risk to get banned on all of my accounts ?

Recently I also started a Cpa + TikTok Journey, but is not going well at all. The strategy that I have in mind is to promote Motiviation / Business clips in order to get an audience who likes these "Self Improvement and Money Making" niche. I make the tiktoks in CapCut using short luxury clips from Pinterest and I add short texts on them, like quotes or other motivation type texts. After that I use an UK SIM card to get to the Uk audience and I post the clips at hours when I think that most of the targeted people would use TikTok. As I said, this strategy doesn't work very well. At the best clip I got only 1K views, all the others remaining blocked at 300 views.

2. How can I improve my TikTok strategy in order to get some money out of it ?
3. What other free traffic strategies would you recomment to me to get the target of 20$ / day ? Also, how hard would it be to get that in 2023 ?

Thanks for your time used to read my journey. You're the best !

I don't know about this method. I don't think it's worth to do that because it would be one more step in order to get to the offer and people wouldn't have the patience to do that. Thanks for the tip tho !

This is how I do it on Facebook and people still go to the landing page. Isn't it better to have a small amount of fewer clicks than getting your accounts banned constantly? If the domain is short and easy to remember, people will still go and type in the domain if they really need what you're providing. If you're posting the same clickable link every single time, the account will get banned, and I'm sure this is the reason your accounts are getting disabled. It is an extra step, but you're saving yourself the hassle of making/buying a new account. I have accounts that are 2 months old constantly sending messages this way with no problem.

My problem are not the links, it is the thing that Facebook take my posts as spam. I don't know what can I do about it.

The link is the spam. You can try having people send you a private message instead and then send them an unclickable link. This is how I do it and I've been able to send over 60,000 messages this month without any bans.

It's not the link, because the post gets deleted instantly, not the comment. I don't put any link in my posts, I only answer to people in the comments with the link sent one time and then I say "Hey ! I just posted more details in the comment above." So yeah, the link is not spammed at all.

Hello, I'm new to CPA, I have a question

Suppose I get traffic from google and when the users land on my website from search results, I immediately redirect them to the CPA link without showing any content. Is this allowed by CPA networks?

Topic: ● UPDATE ●

Well guys, the things are not going pretty good. I just lost all 3 of my Facebook accounts and the offer that I was promoting has rejected me for the reason that my traffic was not good enough for them... I could continue with another offer, but even the manager said that there is nothing as good as the one I was promoting...

I am pretty demoralized and I don't really know what to try next. I am thinking of Pinterest with some USA offer. All I know is that I am done with this Facebook Groups method.

Any tips or ideas for me ?

This is considered direct linking and most networks do not like it - they want a landing page no matter how simple. Beyond that, Google would drop you from search results for doing that because it looks like your website has moved or is down.
