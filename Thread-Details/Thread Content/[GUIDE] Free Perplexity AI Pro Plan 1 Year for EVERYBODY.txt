Topic: Hey guys, had to take a long break from my internet marketing adventures and thought I come back with a cool trick I stumbled upon. As the titles says you get the 1 year pro plan for perplexity ai completely free! No need to buy that shit for 40bucks in the marketplace. It is an incredible powerful tool and its newly integrated deep research is crazy powerful - if you never heard about this tool, go google it and find out more

Here is the guide:

1. Find the "Moj Telekom HR" App in the iOS or Playstore, download it
2. Register with the email of your choice, you are able to switch the language to english
3. After login click on the "I want AI Assistant" promo banner and redeem your code
4. Redeem it here: https://www.perplexity.ai/join/p/magenta
5. Have fun and enjoy

Sidenote: I tested it from a few eu countries but not from the us, not sure if that matters but keep it in mind.

It seems like the codes are valid until end of the month and probably sellable...

Do you have other cool guides and tricks like that? Share them here and help the community - we can achieve way more this way!
