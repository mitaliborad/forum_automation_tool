Topic: Complete Guide to Avoiding Bans on Reddit

Over the past few months, I’ve been studying Reddit intensively and facing multiple bans and shadowbans for seemingly no reason. To prevent this from happening to you, I’ve developed an effective account warming technique.





Here’s the complete guide to keeping your account active and unrestricted.


1. Understanding CQS (Contributor Quality Score)

CQS is a key factor in your Reddit account’s reputation. It does not depend solely on upvotes received but rather on your overall activity.

Important CQS rules:


- Reddit values comments more than posts because mass-posting can be automated, while commenting requires real interaction.


- Accounts with many upvotes only on posts and no interaction in comments are suspicious and may get penalized.


- Giving upvotes doesn’t help at all in account warming. You can build a strong profile without giving a single upvote.


- If you want to give upvotes, do it minimally to avoid looking automated. For every 15 posts you view, give at most 1 upvote.


2. Be Careful with New or Purchased Accounts


New Accounts:


If you don’t have the budget to buy an account, you can create and warm up one yourself. The process is repetitive, but it works.


Warming-up schedule:


- Day 1: Just browse Reddit for at least 15 minutes. Do not interact.


- Day 2: Continue browsing for 15 minutes, but now you can comment up to 2 times and add a brief profile description. Follow up to 5 SFW (Safe For Work) subreddits.


- Day 3: Increase your time on Reddit and interactions. Comment 3 to 4 times, add a profile picture, and follow more subreddits. You can now enable NSFW.


- Day 4: Comment 4 to 6 times, follow more subreddits, and add a banner to your profile. Update your bio with something more detailed.


- Day 5: Comment 5 to 7 times and follow more subreddits.


- Day 6: Comment 6 to 8 times and follow more subreddits.


- Day 7: Comment 7 to 10 times and follow more subreddits.


You can speed this up to 3 days if you’re confident in your method, but 7 days ensure a solid and authentic history.

Purchased Accounts:


The quality of the purchased account can determine whether you’ll get banned or not.


Avoid accounts that:


- Have many upvotes only on posts and very few on comments.


- Haven’t engaged in comments for a long time.


Choose accounts that:


- Have recent comments (no more than 2 weeks old at the time of purchase).


Warming-up process for purchased accounts:


- If the account is from a different country, spend 3 days just browsing before commenting.


- Save posts and videos to mimic human behavior.


- If the account has recent activity, you can start commenting on day 3, gradually increasing engagement until day 5.


3. Daily Warming Routine


I know people making $25,000/month who lose accounts simply because they skip this step.


Reddit hates accounts that are only used for promotion, so you need to act like a regular user.


What you should do daily:


- Spend at least 15 minutes on Reddit.


- Comment regularly, but don’t overdo it.


- You don’t need to post—just engage in comments.


4. Posting (Avoid Looking Like a Bot)



If you spam posts (e.g., 10 in a row), Reddit will penalize your account.


Tips for posting safely:


- Leave gaps between posts (at least 3 minutes).


- Read each subreddit’s rules before posting.


- Avoid automated posting patterns—vary your content.


- Add captions that match your image or video to make posts more natural and engaging.


5. How to Check Your CQS



If you’ve read this far, congrats! Now you’ll learn how to check your CQS.



Simply search “CQS” on Reddit and look for posts with lots of comments.

Topic: I’m halfway through, and I can only say you got a few things right. Comments are worth more than posts. If you have no money, don’t work on Reddit. Upvotes don’t mean much, but they help your account gain trust in the subreddit. Warming up new accounts is useless, and QCS only helps get accounts banned.

Topic: To be frank, none of this warmup phase is needed. Your other information is good but this type of warmup is unnecessary nonsense.

Do you think some normal users aren't signing up and posting or commenting right away? Do you think normal reddit users need to "warm up" their account to start using it?

Sometimes people find Reddit through a google search and then sign up to make a comment, there's many other scenarios where people won't do this.

I register accounts and on day 1 I begin farming karma without issue. I'm not going to leak my personal step by step here but it's all common sense. I didn't find a genie lamp and ask for this ability, I just made a list of common cases where users would engage sooner and experimented.

Lots of people will spend 7 days aging an account and get suspended anyway because they took more importance to this arbitrary info than behaving like a normal user.

I'll give you and everyone one important piece of advice for not needing to warmup. Avoid subreddits related to wholesome content, relationships, news and politics. Look for smaller highly niched subreddits that could be found from a google search by someone interested in that topic (it could be any topic, sfw or nsfw doesn't matter), and start your warmup there.

Don't bother waiting days to comment, think like a normal user and make comments like a normal user. Avoid using ChatGPT and avoid using emojis in comments as much as possible. Make sure everything else is right and you aren't getting fingerprinted, make sure your IP is high quality, and you'll be fine. Nothing else is needed.

I don't, because I have noticed that CQS related subs get watched by people who like to report spam and OF accounts.

To me it feels like a way to catch people who are going to spam in future because most normal people won't check their CQS but marketers will.

However, if for some reason you really want to check CQS, a much better way is to make a subreddit and setup the automod code to do this (such as having it reply to all replies and mention the CQS score). Then you can private the subreddit or delete the posts afterwards.

I agree with some things.

I am directly speaking to people who want to start sharing NSFW content.

The normal approach for someone in content promotion is to want to start posting right away. Since NSFW content is very sensitive, Reddit is very strict with accounts.

Folks, CQS matters because if you don’t want to get banned, you should keep it at least at a moderate level.

I speak from personal experience, as not everyone has the common sense to behave like “a normal user.”

Be careful with that; you should always have one proxy per account.


Reddit does not allow having more than one account per IP.

I speak to people who want to start on Reddit without any amount of money. Reddit is really great.

It’s always useful to warm up accounts, as NSFW content is sensitive, and new accounts will get banned quickly.

I truly want to help beginners. For the safety of your accounts, please follow the basics.

Honestly, I think you've copied bits here and there from other posts. The problem is, you also included the nonsense from others. I'll repeat for the 100th time, QCS is only for getting banned by curious people, normal folks don't check it. The proxies, those static ones aren't good, you should use rotating ones. If you want to copy, at least try to understand what you're reading.

I believe that doing the basics for beginners works. It's not that complicated.

Just check your CQS regularly, post and comment regularly, don't overdo it.

I've had an account for months that I created from scratch and it's never been banned using the techniques I've mentioned.

What exactly? If you making some comentd and don’t get any upvote, It could be a lack of creativity. What I can suggest is that you try talking about something funny that's happening in the post you're commenting on. Or even emotional beings.

In general, look for recent posts from subreddits that are large enough and try to be among the first 3 comments on the post.
