Topic: Hello everyone! Since my previous posts discussing these services have had such a positive reception, I’ve decided to update the list once again with the most current and reliable options available. It really is satisfying to see how useful these lists have been for so many of you, helping to find effective SMS verification services.

This update not only reflects new entries but also incorporates feedback and suggestions from the community, ensuring that the list stays as accurate and comprehensive as possible. Whether you're a long-time follower or new to these posts, my goal remains the same: to save you time and provide trusted solutions for your SMS needs.

Free Options
smspinverify.com ( (https://smspinverify.com/free-number)They offer free and paid services, but their free service works fantastically for platforms like WhatsApp, Burner, and some financial sites like PayPal. The free numbers are exclusively from the USA (free option) and are generally not burner numbers.)
Tempsmss.com (This is a great website for creating Telegram accounts, but you must be the first to use the number. For catching new numbers, it’s advised to follow their Telegram account here. They post new numbers regularly, and if you’re the first to use a number on Telegram, you can successfully create an account.)
sms-activate.guru (https://sms-activate.guru/en/freeNumbers) (This platform is effective for platforms like Tinder, Gmail, Instagram, TikTok, and others, but the drawback is that it only offers numbers for Asian and European countries, with no availability for USA/Canada.)
anonymsms.com (ideal for less common services)
Textrapp.com (They offer a few countries, but the most important ones include USA, Canada, Netherlands, United Kingdom, and Sweden. However, I only recommend this service for a few well-known platforms.)
MobileSMS.io (same like textrapp)
Quackr.io (They offer a wide range of countries and an excellent frontend with strong HCI. However, they require you to create an account to access their free numbers. Additionally, their numbers tend to get burned very quickly due to the high demand on this site.)
SMSPOOL.net (They offer a free option right now but very limited to only a few countries (French, Italian, Latvia, Swedish, Estonian) numbers but this may be an option for specific countries numbers)
receive-sms-online.info
smstome.com: Free services are great for verifying less popular platforms, but they’re often unreliable for financial or dating services. Additionally, while these services are free, it’s important to note that they usually require multiple attempts to succeed. Messages received on these platforms are also visible to anyone, so if you need higher quality and privacy, opting for paid versions is recommended. That said, it’s not impossible—just tricky!
Paid Options
smspinverify.com (Their paid version is excellent, offering competitive prices and a variety of payment options, including Credit/Debit Cards (from Nigeria and South Africa), USDT, Bitcoin, USDC, and LTC. Additionally, they provide the option to rent numbers, allowing you to receive multiple SMS on the same number—a fantastic feature for services like Cash App, eBay, and PayPal that require multiple verifications on the same number. Another notable feature is their Priority Numbers, which act as premium options and work exceptionally well for platforms like Google Voice.)
majorphones.com: (This site is well known because offer high quality numbers for a lot of countries and services, i like this platform because offer short-term numbers (only one use), middle-term numbers (a day of use with unlimited SMS received to the same number) and long-term numbers with 30 days of the same number and this is fantastic to keep with financial services (i used for a stealth payoneer account and worked like a charm). Their prices vary from 0.2$ to 2$ depending on the service for short-term, middle term price is $3 and for long term it is $12. You can check some reviews of this site on trustpilot: https://www.trustpilot.com/review/majorphones.com and other in https://www.reddit.com/r/PrivacyGuides/comments/137arb9/effective_sms_verification_guide/).
smsotpverify.com: (This is a new platform offering reliable numbers for services like Amazon, WhatsApp, Facebook, and Telegram. One standout feature is its API, which is simple to integrate with external sites (API Guide). However, the downside is the lack of long-term number support. In terms of payment, the site accepts credit cards and cryptocurrencies such as LTC, BTC, and ETH. While there’s no 24/7 live chat available, their support team is great, and issues can be resolved through a ticketing system.) Prices start from 0.2$ and the most expensive is Whatsapp with 4.88$ per number.
smspool.com: (This is a well-known site that offers services across many countries at very affordable prices. They accept cryptocurrency and Visa/Mastercard (via Stripe). A significant advantage of this platform is its comprehensive API, which allows users to rent empty SIM cards for 30 days, as well as long-term and short-term numbers. Users can also customize prices for individual services based on the available number pools. For those who prefer not to use the pool, advanced settings let you set the price for specific services when purchasing a number. However, one drawback is the platform's high demand, which sometimes results in the provision of reused numbers, a less-than-ideal situation. The support team is great but typically requires at least 24 hours to address inquiries.)
textverified.com: (Use this service with caution. While some users recommend it for its user-friendliness and effectiveness in verifying accounts on various online platforms, there are mixed reviews on Trustpilot. Positive feedback includes comments like, "Perfect SMS verification! Textverified did what it promised." However, negative reviews highlight issues such as numbers being rejected or not working properly. One user stated, "Tried to verify with a very simple service... Text verification was not accepted... Don't waste your time or money with them." Additionally, Trustpilot has flagged the service with a warning, suggesting potential use of fake reviews.) Trustpilot: https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.textverified.com
non-voip.com: (Prices start at $0.3 and their numbers are very high quality for telegram, google, even Google Voice, Zinli, and others, but this service really works very well. The negative aspect is their API, it is really very bad. I used it a couple of times and it worked really bad. You can't cancel a number, and in some cases they don't have an automatic refund, payment methods are only for cryptocurrency)
smspva.com: (Cheap but burned numbers, you need a lot of patience if you need a number, the plus is that they offer a lot of countries. Long-term numbers are too bad)
tardigrada.io: Similar to smsotpverify.
mmohub.io: Good for Tinder, but the problem is the language of the web (Vietnam only), you can use google translator.
sms-verify.me: Good for PayPal
sms-activate.guru: (They have free plans but I only tested the paid plan, it was good and full automatic, when phone numbers don't work or are already taken, they refund the balance).
verifysms.io: Alternative if you want to use textverified, only offer USA numbers and 80 services.
anosim.net: They offer physical sim cards for rent.
codesverify.com/: Alternative to smspva.com.
smscode.net: Don't have a frontend and it's a private pool of sim cards, but works good for short-term numbers!
These are the websites I have used, as well as those many of you have praised for their effectiveness in my previous posts. I decided to update the list and include your recommendations as well. Happy New Year! Don’t forget to read the comments, as new suggestions come up every day.

Thanks for your feedback! Another good service is smsotpverify.com (it's a paid site) but works very good too and offers cheap prices!

I am very disappointed by OP because he effectively promoted something that turns out it's not true. I just tested the only provider he says offers "reliable numbers" for Facebook, and guess what - it doesn't. I tried two so called "Facebook Operators", waited 15 minutes in total for nothing, and no code was received by Facebook. On the screenshot you will notice a text in red that also doesn't correspond with reality. I vouch that I have personally used local Facebook accounts accessed via local IP address and yet have verified them with numbers from Ireland, Turkey, Croatia, etc on a "SMS-platform" which I can't mention here.

It's good to write tutorials, but instead of just chasing post likes, you should make sure they don't contain lies because of which people will lose money.

Thanks for your review and I am really sorry for what happened to you, I mentioned it because in previous posts I read several users mentioning its use for this service. Did you try to contact support? It could be a puntual bug.

Nothing so far, although it's not an issue which the Support Staff can solve, it's the type of technology they use. If their services don't work for receiving codes from Facebook, they should not have such offer and lure people to top-up a balance that will never be refunded. My only reason to try this service was your post, thinking it actually works unlike most of the others. But, no.
