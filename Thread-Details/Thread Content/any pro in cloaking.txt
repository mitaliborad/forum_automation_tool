Topic: Hi guys, I've been doing some researches on cloaking, and there's a few things i'm missing if anyone could answer i'd be very grateful

So from what I understood there's ad cloaking and payment cloaking, but there's few informations I found on payment cloaking (linking the products between the white shop and black shop), it this step not obligatory to run my business ? (i wanna try launching a replica luxury brand business).
I understood that ad cloaking is absolutely necessary to effectively reach audience on google ads but what is payment cloaking necessary for ? Is it that payment processor will get quickly blocked at the first customer that ask a refund/dispute.


I'm tryna learn how to cloaking ads and payments but if there's good services that would do that for me here I'm open to hear proposals.
If a kind soul is okay to explain to me in details would be grateful as well,

Thanks in advance guys.

I also sell Replica products. I use Shopify Payments on a completely white store and WordPress on a black site. When someone clicks "Buy Now," they are redirected directly to the Shopify checkout page, not the product page. The checkout is automatically and instantly created with the product's price from WordPress. I have been working with this setup for over 5 months.
Do you have tips to set up this kind of redirection ?
