Topic: The first screenshot looks like you have run out of target urls for the software to try to submit to, and every email address you have added to your project has already been used when trying to sign up for accounts. So you either need to scrape more target urls, or subscribe to a list service.

The second screenshot is subjective - are those the number of verified links you were wanting to end up with?

unfortunately GSA SER is a victim of googles serp update that requires javascript to view results at any meaningful rate. there are some country-specific search engines in SERs roster that can give target urls, but mainly i would recommend you look elsewhere for target urls/scraping
