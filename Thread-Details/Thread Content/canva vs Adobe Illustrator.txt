Topic: There are many cavna users here as not many can afford adobe out the bat starting off. However I wouldn't touch cavna, since I know illustrator and photoshop pretty well, and can use freepik and chatgpt ai images.

The benefits of canva, are simple quick and free. Maybe others have some dedicated tips to they can share on what works for them? I don't think you'll find something NOT in illustrator or photoshop though!! illustrator is too good! But i'd love to hear
The best WP themes I have ever used are with Themify. They have a great range and are all secure, updated, and affordable

Topic: Nothing new, I would say since I don't know how to use Photoshop or Illustrator well . Canva learning curve is fast. I learn fast just never been interested in learning too much about adobe products.

It’s not comparable. A better tool to compare with illustrator would be inkscape or figma if you prefer web based editor. They don’t have AI features though.

If you were looking for a free alternative, I would definitely recommend learning inkscape.

hmmm Inkscape has been there for a long time. Not sure if it predates Photoshop though.

Topic: canva is pretty useful for quick and simple designs, but it’s definitely more for beginners or non-designers if you need advanced tools, like precise vector editing or creating detailed, scalable designs, Illustrator is the way to go. canva just doesn’t have those pro level features imo

Topic: Canva is intuitive, easy to use and helpful for quick editions. Illustrator is more professional and require more advanced skills. They are both useful for different kind of people, picking between them will depends on your own personal knowledge about image edition and experience on this matter
