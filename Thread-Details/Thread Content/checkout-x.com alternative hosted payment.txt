checkout-x.com alternative hosted payment

Topic User: dynamicotptp
Topic: hello
i used checkout-x for 3years ago "woocomerce'" but unfortunately they are closed forever
I'm asking if you know of any website that provides hosted payment where I can link PayPal and Stripe to it. I tried to find it using Google, but no result. No one does the same job.

thank you

Carflows is funnel builder, I using that to design the checkout page, but don't have hosted checkout page with payment integration.

Topic: Hey! Yeah, Checkout-X shutting down was a blow. You might wanna check out ThriveCart, PayKickstart, or SamCart—they support PayPal and Stripe and offer hosted checkout solutions. Another option is Lemon Squeezy if you're selling digital products. Hope that help
