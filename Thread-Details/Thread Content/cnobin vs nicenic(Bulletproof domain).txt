Topic: Between Cnobin and Nicenic, I'd lean towards Cnobin for a bulletproof domain. It tends to have a stronger reputation for privacy and security, but it’s good to do your own research too.

njal.la is bullshit
cnobin/nicenic
Hi,

I currently have a domain with nicenic and I got a DMCA report regarding a product on my website. Then nicenic emailed me to delete the content within 48 hours.

That was their email:

Dear valued customer,

We received complaint as attached which claimed that the following domain name under your account violated relevant terms and conditions and we were requested to suspend these domain names.

xyz com

Before we take any action, we hope to hear your suggestion about how we should handle the issue.

We pay absolutely high attention to our customer's right and interest and make best effort to lower the loss.

We look forward to hearing back from you in the next 48 hours in case of domain suspension!


for example: if the reported URL is xyz com/123 , then i tell nicenic that i removed the product at this URL and move the product to a new URL , for example : xyz com/852 ?

is this the way to handle DMCA reports ?


Recently, I asked nicenic directly whether they ignore DMCA reports or not, that was their reply:

We really hope to help, but you know we are ICANN Accredited Registrar, we can't ignore DMCA reports even it is not applicable for our law.

We much appreciate your understanding!



Appreciate your insight on this topic, everybody.

Would you know if either can register IDNs under any TLDDs besides once in Chinese or if you can offer this as a reseller? Particularly anything in non-English latin, cyrillic, or greek scripts?

This is not bad actually - what I hate is registrars who suspend you without notification and no chance to correct whatever problem exists.
