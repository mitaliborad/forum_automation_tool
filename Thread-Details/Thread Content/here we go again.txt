Topic: You can check out genfamer. They have software and hardware. But maybe because of different countries issue so you can buy hardware yourself which are old android phones

Welcome to the forum. This forum is a great place for IM marketer.

Actually, I just recently started working with an Android farm. Until now, I’ve been doing a lot of automation projects that brought in quite a decent income. Over time, a million ideas came to mind, so I decided to start building a farm. Currently, I have one active farm focused on creating Gmail accounts, which I store in a private database for future plans. A second farm is currently in development and will serve as the most secure 4G proxy system in the world—it will operate completely autonomously, with no human intervention needed. On top of that, triangular device location tracking will be very complicated, and in the worst-case scenario, if SIMs get blocked, we simply replace them with new ones.


The plan is very complex, but the privacy is 100% guaranteed, especially since I’m lucky to live in a country that’s pretty much a “gray zone” for this kind of activity. If anyone else has Android farms or similar advanced systems, feel free to reach out. I’m not a fan of VM emulators or similar setups because they just can’t offer what a physical device can.

Welcome to the forum, mate. That's some interesting stuff right there. I am not even a beginner in this area. So, how many devices do you have in your Android farm?

Topic: Hello black dolphin,

Welcome to blackhatworld forum..

It would be nice, if you keep some black dolphin as your profile picture instead of irrelevant marijuana leaf

Enjoy your stay happy..

My farm currently consists of two Android boxes running on S9 and S10 devices used for gathering Gmail accounts. At the moment, I’m collecting full devices—again S9/S10 models—that will be used for proxy purposes. I work professionally in 3D printing and have huge capabilities when it comes to developing custom enclosures that will house the entire devices.


What about you? What’s your experience with Android farms? Do you own any Android boxes? What exactly are you working on?

I don’t know much about android farming. I am more into the software side rather than the hardware.

Well, if u write everything I’ve done so far, it will take ages. I’ve done a lot of stuff during my years in IM from cybersecurity, log analysis, to deploying custom tools for clients. Apart from that, I’ve dabbled in SEO, media buying, YT, CPA, and a lot of other stuff that I cannot remember at the moment. apart from all this, i have a job that helps me to remain updated about the current tech and trends.

Right now, I am working on a case study involving mass content publishing behind a forum. Let’s see how it goes.
