hi everyone almost new here

Topic: I say almost because I have been lurking on this forum for a quiet a while now

A little about me: I’m a full-stack developer specializing in niche adult websites. I’ve worked extensively with large-scale NSFW databases and automation, and I’m looking to help others create their own adult websites.

I’ve been building these websites for over two years now. In the beginning, setting up a VPS and integrating DoodStream, embeds (which is now gone , along with a lot of platforms I used to rely on) was a pain, but good platforms like Streamwish, UpStream. This forum, ****, and a few Discord groups have been great resources for learning and connecting with others in the space.

What’s even better is that developers are constantly building new tools that make things so much easier. Back then, setting up an adult site meant dealing with endless server configurations, embedding videos manually, and troubleshooting outdated scripts. Now, APIs handle everything—just call an endpoint, and you instantly have millions of videos ready to go.

For example, I found a guy on Reddit from **** who’s building an API that does exactly that. No need to set up a server or manually embed videos anymore—it’s all handled for you. Just focus on the frontend and ads. That’s a huge improvement over how I used to do things with WP-Script, which was always a pain in the ass with its outdated themes.

Looking forward to sharing what I’ve learned and seeing what everyone else is working on!

paddict69420, adult niche expertise is niche, sure—but if you’ve cracked large-scale automation, drop the specific API names, traffic stats, or compliance workarounds. Otherwise, this just reads like a stealth promo for that Reddit guy’s API. BHW’s seen a million ‘streamlined’ adult sites nuked by payment processors—prove yours aren’t ticking time bombs.

Topic: thats my bad i wasnt trying to promo anything, i just saw that post recently thats all, tbh the api sucks at the moment anyway i have tried it but the api search is super slow, but the only reason i tried is because hes converting all the csv from webmasters affiliate, xhamser, pornhub, hes the only one that has a huge database like this but again it doesnt even cache the response so everything is so slow, i just brought it up because its cool project, there are more developers out thier with my same mindset,

Topic: Hello paddict,

Welcome to Blackhatworld Forum..

Make sure to read forum Rules and terms.

As an upgrade member - You can offer your services to BHW community, until then you can't sell services now.

To sell service on the BHW - You have two options:

1) Get 100 messages on the forum and wait a couple of months till your account is old like 2 months then you can upgrade to Jr.Vip membership
( min after 60 days)

2- Get a marketplace membership (it costs $749 / year. Then you can sell your services right away.

Don't :

1- Offer your services without the above requirements.
2- Offer your services via PM

Selling or advertising outside of the marketplace is against the rules and will inhibit your ability to sell via the above process.

Welcome to BHW! There's a few of us from the adult world floating around.

Anyhow, my piece of advice to you is to read the terms and rules down in the footer and always check forum sections before posting. There's sometimes additional rules. So read, read, read in order to avoid warnings, like promoting other sites/groups.

Another thing you'll want to be aware of is there's criteria for being able to sell your services. However, there's plenty of opportunity to discuss creating websites and what not! As someone who used to work on a very, very, very large affiliate website (with THE database of all databases) I'm looking forward to seeing what you have to say!
Engagement thrives where knowledge is shared and tips spark discovery—let’s grow together!
