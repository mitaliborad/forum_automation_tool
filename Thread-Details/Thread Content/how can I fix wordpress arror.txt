Topic: 1) how did you add the tool's code to WP? Via plugin / block, or directly into WP's source code?
2) what kind of tool is that? I mean, what does it do?

Topic: First, the thing to fix is your code not WP because WP worked well until you installed your plugin right?

I’m not a WP expert nor WP dev but i do have learned about Web development since a few days ago.

Regarding your issue, you must be more clear about what you have done in the first place.
But i had a similar issue , adding a new plugin code into the WP website but not installed .

What was the issue? Exactly that, i didn’t installed the plugin through the WP Admin so the database doesn’t recognize it & loaded the tables and as result got the website distorsioned because the code was added succesfully.

What I do to solve ? Make the code an installable plugin as usually they are made , uninstall and install it again but through the admin panel.

Another thing to bear in mind , the character codification at the database —ie utf8

1.

JavaScript Conflicts: If your tool contains JavaScript, it's possible that the scripts conflict with existing scripts in the WordPress theme or other plugins. You can check if this is the issue by disabling JavaScript temporarily or by viewing the site in the browser’s developer console (F12 in most browsers) to check for errors.
Solution: Try wrapping your JavaScript in a document.ready() (for jQuery) or window.onload function to ensure it only runs once the page is fully loaded. You could also use WordPress hooks like wp_footer() or wp_head() to include your scripts in a safe way.
CSS Conflicts: Similarly, CSS styles from your tool may conflict with the theme’s styles.
Solution: Scope your CSS rules to be more specific to avoid overriding theme styles. Use more specific selectors, or consider adding a unique class or ID to your tool’s wrapper HTML element to target its styles.
