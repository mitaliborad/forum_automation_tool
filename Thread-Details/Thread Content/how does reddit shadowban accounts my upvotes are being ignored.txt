Topic: hello! i made a reddit account generator that can generate 300 accounts per hour, the problem is, the accounts can sometimes be unusable, below are my observations

i first used bulk IPORT proxies i bought from oxylabs and proxyscrape, sadly, seems like im not the only one using the proxies and going to reddit.com it shows "You’ve been blocked by network security" for about 60% of the proxies, however, if i keep generating accounts, im able to generate 50, i also recorded the IP addresses they were generated in, i made a script that logs in the accounts via the same proxies they were generated and upvote a post, only a few are able to upvote, BUT they are able to upvote

now, because some IP addresses are blocked i switched to a residential proxy from oxylabs, the problem is, even if i use session parameters, a proxy is only available for one day until it is replaced, so, the accounts are logged in via a random ip, im not sure if that is the problem, but if i attempt to upvote a post from any of the accounts i generated, it NEVER updates, i refresh the page and the upvotes return to the original count

is there any way i can bypass this? currently im looking into using the bulk iport proxies again instead of a rotating one, but the problem is, they are detected and sometimes blocked by reddit

Topic: Try using mobile proxies instead of bulk IP/proxy providers, Reddit is much more lenient with mobile traffic.

Topic: Yes, you'd need to warm those accounts, if possible using 4G Mobile proxies, the success rate tends to improve

Topic: Residential proxies are IPs from real devices, so Reddit’s less likely to flag them compared to datacenter ones. Your rotating proxy might be messing up sessions, which is why upvotes aren’t sticking.

i actually found that out, i was using data center proxies at first because it was cheap, and most of the proxies are already blocked by reddit, i switched to residentials ones and i have better results, although the accounts are one day old, naturally reddit still ignores the upvote, ill come back in a few days and warm it up

Topic: I have heard of something like "vote fuzzing", which means the settings of some subreddits to hide votes initially to discourage vote manipulation.
Being shadow-banned is also a possibility, for which you can appeal through https :// www. reddit. com/appeals
Though, as we all know that most of these big social media platforms do not care a hoot for us users.

create your own private proxies and reach the accounts to high/highest CQS at least, then start using them for upvotes. Once the account is solid, upvoting is much easier and it will survive without issues. You can reach 50-100 upvotes per day per account, and make sure to do everything manually, any scripts touching your accounts, they will be auto-flagged

it is not vote fuzzing i believe, it's just straight up suspending accounts, i can check at https://www.reddit.com/user/[account's username] that reddit says it is suspended

Topic: If your upvotes are being ignored, it might be a sign of a shadowban on Reddit, even if you’re unaware of it. Shadowbanning is typically a result of violating Reddit's guidelines in some way, whether it’s through spammy behavior, low-quality content, or rule-breaking in specific subreddits.
