Topic: Posting 1 or 2 times daily is enough. If you have a good number of followers, posting once a day is recommended. You need to engage them and make them eager for your next post. This creates curiosity and attracts more visitors.

Posting 2-3 times daily is fine as long as the content is high-quality and engaging

you can post that much a day, and it can work well once you've built a consistent audience...

Topic: Posting 2 to 3 times daily on TikTok is generally acceptable and can enhance engagement. TikTok recommends posting 1 to 4 times per day. To avoid overwhelming your audience, it's advisable to space out your posts by 3 to 4 hours. Consistency and content quality are key factors in maintaining and growing your audience.
