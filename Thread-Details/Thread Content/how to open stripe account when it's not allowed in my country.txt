Topic: If Stripe isn’t supported in your country, the common workaround is to register through a supported country using clean documents and verified info that match the IP location. To do it safely, you should:
– Use a residential proxy from the target country
– Open the account inside an antidetect browser (multilogin, gologin, hidemyacc,etc.)
– Make sure all the info (name, address, phone, browser fingerprint) aligns with the proxy’s IP region
Avoid logging into the same account from random devices or IPs afterward. Once you’ve set it up properly, stick with that same environment to reduce the risk of bans.
As for buying a Stripe account, it’s possible, but only do it if you fully trust the seller and you're ready to manage it carefully with proper setup. Otherwise, it can get flagged fast.

Topic: If Stripe isn’t supported in your country, going the “stealth + offshore entity” route is pretty much the only stable option. I’ve seen people use EU-based companies (Estonia, Bulgaria, etc.) with a clean site and docs that match the setup - works fine if done right.

Just using a VPN or rented account without structure usually gets flagged fast. If you're serious, better to invest in the full stack: company, address, domain, and a clean offer to onboard smoothly.

You can set-up a company in one of the supported countries.

Best options are US LLC, UK LTD, HK LTD or EE LTD.

Opening a company in one of these countries will allow you to get an account without any problem.

Only exception is if you come from heavily sanctioned countries. In this case, opening a company will not solve your problem and you maybe need to use nominees.

Topic: Buying one sounds risky, I'd explore using a VPN or incorporating in a Stripe-supported country first – worth the hassle to avoid future headaches.

Topic: Opening a stripe account via a supported country with proper setup( like a US LLC) is safer than buying one. Use machine details and stable login to avoid getting flagged.
