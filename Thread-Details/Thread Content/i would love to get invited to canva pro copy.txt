Topic: Yeah, finding a working invite can be a pain. Have you tried checking the stickied threads? Sometimes there are official giveaways there.

Topic: You’ll find expired invites because you’re late to the party – BHW moves fast and old posts disappear quickly. Post fresh content, engage, provide value, and close valid offers – you’ll get some activity in days, not weeks.
