Topic: have you tried tools like Figma to HTML or stuff like htmlcss.to ? if not for real high quality you’d have to do it manually like coding based on the design from the image but it takes longer

Topic: if it’s a 2d non-editable image then you’ll have to use tools like adobe illustrator or photoshop to slice the elements and recreate the design in html css otherwise check out software like gimp if you don’t have the paid ones

Guess you still have to do it manually if you want it to look good.

Topic: For high-quality HTML from an image, avoid automated tools and go manual. Use Figma or Adobe XD. Write clean HTML + CSS, using Tailwind or Bootstrap for efficiency.
Optimize images, prefer SVGs.
