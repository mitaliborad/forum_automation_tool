Topic: Is writing everything relevant to user's query in single article good? for example , I have two keywords of great search volume like 1 ( what is Loan ) and 2.(types of loan). so should I target both keywords in a single post or create different post for each kw.

Option A - Writing a single post and cover both keyword
Option B - Writing two post for each keyword.

what would you choose?

The best option is to create separate posts for each keyword. This allows for focused content, better SEO, and a better user experience.

Topic: I'd cover both keywords in a single article.
Basically, I'd add loan types with short descriptions for each loan type and then link to pages describing each loan type in detail.

Topic: Do both, you can either make single post for each keyword and then make comprehensive article about all of this keyword. Make sure to link each other.

Topic: Write separate posts for each keyword first, then later combine them into one big post. This way, you cover both bases.

Topic: I recommend both options, but Option A is also a good choice because a single article can provide a comprehensive, long-form overview of both topics

Topic: when you are writing a content make sure that all the content is focused on the topic, yes its good to add all the necessary details in the content but all the writting should be focused on the keyword or topic. its good to add the related information but not in deeply, if the topic is too wide cover it in multiple posts not in a single content. To identify the word length of the content analyse the top 10 ranking content. from there you should have an idea about how many words you have to write.

Topic: The best approach is Option A: Creating content for both keywords in a single post. Since these are related keywords (e.g., "loan" and "types of loans"), they can be effectively covered together in one post.

In my opinion, it's better to combine them into a single page.

Topic: Like someone said a similar thing.

Write for both subtopics separately so you can use the exact KW in the title. Title is very important in SEO.

However, write briefly about the other subtopic in your post, and interlink.

Topic: Both will work. But if you go for option B, you add more value to the article and you can avoid stuffing too many keywords in the single article. Using too many keywords in a single article is not recommended.

Topic: I split one article into an infinite number of articles, then I split those infinite articles into sub-infinite number of articles, then those sub-infinite numbers I split into sub-sub-infinite numbers of articles.

Hence I consider this a limited realm to do 2 articles.

Topic: The first option is the best one to go with and create articles with different keyword variations

Because focusing on only one keyword for a full article is not good so better to use a variation of keywords in the article

Topic: You can use both keywords in the article, But Keyword Stuffing is the problem, The ratio of the keywords is important in the article,

For example, if you write the article in 500 words and repeat the same word multiple times, it creates an issue.
