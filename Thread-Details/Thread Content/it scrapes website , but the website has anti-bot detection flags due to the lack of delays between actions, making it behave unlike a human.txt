Topic: it scrapes website , but the website has anti-bot detection flags due to the lack of delays between actions, making it behave unlike a human.

THE CODE is written in "go lang", and it use Rod library.The problem
I was new to web scraping and I was trying to create a scraper which scarpe data and otput json file.

But the site kept rejecting my connection because it thought that I was a bot, so I used UserAgent to create a fake useragent string to try and bypass the filter.

It 's not worked. But the problem was that the first time i run the scraper to the website by a browser, it work , but when i tried after it doesn't anymore

Mabye I have to lok more humna ?antiMashDelay: 500 // ms. Or i should use undetected-chromedriver?

Topic: Instead of just delays, maybe try randomizing your mouse movements and scroll patterns – sites can often detect unnatural patterns there too.

Topic: Things to consider:
Random wait: random wait, for example something random in range 500 ± 300 ms
Random click: get the center of button and random click area
Random move: random move the mouse even there's no action required
Random scenario: sometimes move and click to wrong place
More fingerprints: if use another account, try another browser, or use antidetect browser
More IPs: each user account should be on a diff IP
Try it and get back with more feedback.
