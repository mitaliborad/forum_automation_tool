Topic: You can use keywordtool.io/pinterest for Pinterest to assist with keyword research.

You can also simply type one or two words into Pinterest's search bar, such as "home styles" and collect the long-tail keyword suggestions that appear.

That's exactly what I was doing, and it worked very well...

In a mix with the Pinterest "Trends Tool", these methods should be more than enough to find what you're looking for.

Tags for pinterest are special hashtags that help your promotion through the pinterest algorithm.

Can anyone tell me how to upload a pin on pinterest with size 736 by 1635 I often come across such pins in the feed, but when I download the same images or create my own (also 736 by 1635 in size), Pinterest cuts them off, and I get regular pins and not long ones, can anyone tell me how to solve this situation
