Topic: People don't use it the way it was once used. I don't think it's even used as social media anymore. It's essentially used to showcase music.

No, because I had it back when it was hip and the only social network around. Back before fakebook was out, but only open to college kids. I hadn't logged into it in YEARS though. Trippy to see the photos of people I used to hang with then.

Yeah, I'm old. I still remember usenet, archie, veronica and BBSs and when I'd play poker with T-Rex, he always had a hard time getting the cards off the table...

I can and have fairly recently. I also still have the email it's tied to, so that helps.
