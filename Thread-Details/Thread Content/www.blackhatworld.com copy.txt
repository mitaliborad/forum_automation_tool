TCP fingerprint residential proxies do not match

Topic: Recently I came across a screaming problem. I make all my fingerprint spoof in DESKTOP correctly, impeccably.

Therefore, when you verify the TCP fingerprint two proxies used, or even 75% of the time we see them as ANDROID. I have tested various services and mostly also offer residential proxies, including TCP and Android.

Does anyone know any REALLY residential proxy? that delivers or TCP fingerprint correctly?

I understand that the residential proxy should deliver a RESIDENTIAL TCP FINGERPRINT.

Topic: That’s a solid observation — many so-called “residential proxies” are actually tunneled through Android devices or cheap mobile setups, which can lead to mismatched TCP/IP fingerprints.

A true residential proxy should have:
A desktop OS-level signature (not Android),
Proper TCP/IP behavior (window size, TTL, MSS) matching that of home ISP connections,
No signs of mobile NAT or CGNAT routing.


Your best bet:
Look for ISP proxies or wired residentials rather than mobile or hotspot-based ones.
Some premium providers offer TCP-level fingerprint customization — not just user-agent spoofing.
Ask providers directly about the TCP stack source (e.g., is it tunneled via Android or true desktop environment?).


Most providers won’t advertise this, but a few do specialize in TCP-consistent setups for anti-fraud-sensitive use cases. You might want to post in the https://www.blackhatworld.com/forums/want-to-buy.92/ section and specify your exact TCP fingerprinting needs — that’ll filter out the noise fast.

What do you mean?
Count how many Androids are at people's houses? In 2025, genZ doesn't use PC's
