Topic: I have tried many websites that sell mobile proxies, and most of them were bad, with frequent disconnections and very slow speeds. I want your experience—what is the best mobile proxy service provider that works excellently for targeting the American audience on TikTok? Let’s benefit from our experiences. Imagine the benefits we could gain by sharing each one of our experiences.
Here’s the translation of your text into English:

I'll start with myself, the bad experience:
GridPanel: Poor quality proxy, worst customer service
Proxy-Seller: very frequent internet disconnections with slow internet speed.
I am also still testing some other service providers and will update the topic. Please share your experience with a mobile proxy service provider only.

Finding a reliable mobile proxy for TikTok can be tricky since performance depends on speed, stability, and real-time rotation. Some providers offer better consistency with U.S.-based IPs, but even then, connection drops can happen. If you're facing frequent disconnections, you might want to test smaller providers that offer dedicated sessions or real SIM-based proxies for better results.

Do you recommend anyone who provides proxy services with a real SIM?
