Topic: Where do you guys like to get mobile proxies from? I am setting up M/S method right now using Fanzella and proxies are expensive. For mother slave, do you guys ever do more than one account per proxy? I've heard people say to do 1 account per proxy to prevent bans but honestly, that doesn't seem very financially feasible and I'm expecting for some of the accounts to end up compromised anyways. Any advice or guidance is very much appreciated

Topic: Honestly, I try to see if theres a provider offering free trails and stuff. As for accounts per proxy, yeah best to stick to a 1:1. Some people are a tad ambitious and opt for a more 5 accounts to 1 proxy but theres a risk of detection. Also unless youre handling 50+ accounts, not worth the strain and risking the lives of the accounts to detection

Topic: Yes definitely have 1 proxy per account and start small. Don't worry about scaling just yet. Get things running with around 5 accounts and see how it goes

Topic: You can find providers on this site, at least the ones here are checked for legitimacy before they're allowed to advertise. You can also ask the seller for a test period just to be sure their proxy works on your tools and for your purposes before committing to a paid period.

Instagram are very strict these days. You need to use one account per proxy, and it's expensive when managing multiple accounts.
