Using Phone as a mobile hotspot proxy

Total comments in the thread: 13

Topic: Hello, I know people have turned extra cell phone lines into mobile proxies.

Am I ok to run a hotspot from an extra phone and just turn the internet on and off to get a new ip?
I am running android on a pixel phone in the USA. Will sites be able to see that I am running a hotspot from a phone?

My cell provider is throttling me to 5ge is that an issue or a give away?

I am making new accounts on reddit with adspower and I am having some difficulty in getting posts through. I am warming my accounts up for like 10 days sometimes with 100+ Karma and I am still having my posts removed. This makes me think it might be a proxy issue.

Any advice would be much appreciated!

It's your content, not your ip. It's fine if you use a hotspot, reddit doesn't care much about mobile IPs since ip blocking anything behind a CGNAT is not possible.

I am checking my ip every time to make sure it has a new one.

I am now reading that I might have a small pool of ips?

Topic: Using a hotspot from an extra phone can work, but there are some issues to consider:
IP Reputation: Mobile IPs are often shared (carrier-grade NAT) and may already be flagged by Reddit.
Hotspot Detection: Sites can detect hotspots via TTL differences or browser fingerprints. Use tools like Adspower to randomize fingerprints.
Throttling: Throttling itself isn’t a giveaway, but low-reputation IPs might be problematic.
Tips:
Test your IP reputation.
Use dedicated mobile/residential proxies for cleaner IPs.
Warm up accounts longer (2–3 weeks) with organic activity.
Ensure Adspower profiles have unique fingerprints and avoid repetitive posting patterns.
If posts still get removed, try a test account on a clean IP to confirm if the hotspot setup is the issue.

Running a hotspot from your phone can work as a basic mobile proxy, but websites may still detect it based on network patterns or frequent IP changes. The throttling to 5GE shouldn’t be an issue, but if your carrier assigns CGNAT (shared) IPs, it could raise flags. If Reddit is still removing your posts despite warming up accounts, consider testing different IP ranges or using a dedicated mobile proxy with stable session control to reduce suspicion.

Topic: Yes, you can use a phone hotspot as a mobile proxy, but there are things to keep in mind:
IP Reputation – Mobile IPs are shared (CGNAT), so they might already be flagged. A fresh IP doesn’t always mean a clean one.
Hotspot Detection – Some sites detect hotspots using TTL values, browser fingerprints, and network patterns. Using Adspower is good, but ensure your fingerprints are well-randomized.
Throttling & Stability – 5GE throttling isn’t a giveaway, but if your connection is unstable, Reddit might see unusual behavior, making account warming less effective.
Tips to Improve Success:
Use a 4G Mobile Static Proxy – It keeps a consistent IP while still looking like a real user.
Test Your IP Reputation – Check if the IP is flagged before using it.
Extend Warm-Up Time – Try 2-3 weeks of organic engagement before posting.
Vary Your Content – Even with a clean proxy, repetitive content patterns get flagged.
A mobile static proxy helps by giving you a stable, real-user IP with less risk of being flagged. It’s worth the investment if you're serious about avoiding detection.

nothing in this case if anything its worse. if he is using 1 same account then the static proxy is fine but if he is doing multiple accs he needs rotating mobile proxy so he can change ip every time he logs into another acc.

Topic: Look reddit is too strict these days its not only your ip at fault there could be several reasons leading to ban, like what type of content, whats your cqs, have u posted link in your profile or comment and such. so without full information you cant only blame your ip

+1 for this.

Make sure you post good content which is not against Reddiquette and you are using the right settings for your antidetect browser.
