Reach US TikTok (Proxy, Sim, ...) - I've read +100 threads and still in doubt

Total comments in the thread: 4

Topic: I need to do TikTok marketing for some apps, never did this before but in the last few weeks I've read a lot of content from multiple sources and some threads here in BHW were the most helpful one.

But, the problem is that after reading +100 threads I still don't get what's the best setup.

Some people say the best is to use Mobile Proxies with rotating IPs, other say static Residential Proxies are the best, others say you shouldn't use proxy and instead use just a US e-SIM...

What I already know:
- I bought an used iPhone from eBay
- I will factory reset it with a new US Apple ID
- I will have a maximum of 3 accounts per platform per device
- I will create a brand new TikTok account and warm it up interacting like a user for a week with my target audience

Questions:
- Residential Proxy vs. Mobile Proxy ? Should I use static or let the IPs rotate?
- Is it ok to use pay-per-GB proxy provider?
- Can I use cheaper proxy providers although with good ratings(Soax, Evomi, DataImpulse)?
- If I use a proxy will I still need a us e-SIM? Even if I create the TT account with email instead of phone number?
- The best way to setup the proxy is using apps like Shadowrocket or on the network itself?

This forum is really helpful, thanks!

You're definitely heading in the right direction with your current setup. Mobile proxies with rotating IPs are typically the safest choice for TikTok, especially if you're managing multiple accounts. Static residential proxies tend to raise flags due to unnatural usage patterns.
Pay-per-GB proxies can be cost-effective for limited interactions, but heavy use (like frequent video uploads, interactions, or warming up accounts) could quickly consume your data allowance, potentially becoming expensive. Unlimited data proxies might be more economical in the long run for sustained use.

Providers like Soax, Evomi, or Datalmpulse can be decent for budget solutions if their reviews are positive, but keep in mind that shared IP pools might reduce IP quality and increase ban risk. A specialized mobile proxy provider usually offers more stable performance and fewer detection issues.
An eSIM isn't strictly required if you're registering via email and using reliable proxies, though having a U.S. eSIM does add an additional authenticity layer that helps prevent platform detection.
Finally, using apps such as Shadowrocket for setting up proxies tends to be simpler and more manageable than direct network configuration, especially if you're just starting out.

Let me know if you have any other questions or need more clarity!
