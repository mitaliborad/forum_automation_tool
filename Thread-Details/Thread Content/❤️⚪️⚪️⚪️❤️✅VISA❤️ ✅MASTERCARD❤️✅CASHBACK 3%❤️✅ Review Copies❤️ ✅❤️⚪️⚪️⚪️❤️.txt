Topic: There was no mention of a $10 minimum monthly payment in the thread. Other than that, the website looks great and the service is very interesting. What are the requirements for PST Private?

Hi,
Monthly payment you mentioned is the card maintenance fee, just like any other bank cards have
As for PST Private, there are minimum $30k monthly spend to enroll, yet we may offer more favorable conditions for users with confirmed $10k+ spend starting
Thank you and have a nice day!
