2025-04-09 10:40:50,886 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: I am wondering if it is good practice for LinkedIn SEO, if I link after a post to a blog post on my homepage/ sales page. Ideally, I would like to post informational content and then link to my homepage as CTA.

Does this practice hurt the performance of the post?
Does someone maybe have resources that answer this?
