2025-04-18 09:37:38,049 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Dear all
Happy New Year!

I'm looking for a reliable, respectfull people/support, CHEAP registrar, to move my 90 domain names from namesilo to that new one.

Important is the price of course (mostly .com) and to be reliable, and to be able to register the domain as ns too (if required).

I'd extremely appreciate your suggestions as I'd like to start moving asap.

Last, what is your opinion about porkbun, are they worth it, are they reliable & fair? Or what alternative would you suggest? (cheap is a must due to the quantity).

Many thanks!
