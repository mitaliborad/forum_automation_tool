2025-04-18 11:19:58,763 - DEBUG - Extracted main post content: Hi,

• I am creating a website where business customers will be making trade purchases, it's a B2B site.
• It is a WordPress site.
• Trade customers will have a login so they can get into their dashboard.
• Each login will be manually added as a user, by us, when we have approved and accepted them as a client.
• I think each customer will be given "Subscriber" status, unless there is a better option.
• There are 2 products they can choose from.
• They can only see the products to choose from and trade pricing once logged in, (2 products required now with possibility to add more later)

I want some form of interface (as simple as possible as long as it fulfils my basic requirements) once a user is logged in so they can see the 2 products and then place an order, which then gets sent to me via email or notification of some sort so we can arrange dispatch. At the same time that the user can get an email confirming the order with details of how to pay (which will be via BACS, UK system) or cash on delivery (if we are delivering to a local customer).

A free tool would be preferred as this is a new enterprise, probably less than 10 per month at first. With the possibility to scale as and when the site grows, to be able to process more orders and more products selection, obviously then most likely going onto a paid plan (if necessary).

I'm not sure a basket is required, but I guess it could be done that way?
Any recommendations of WP plugin to do this, or an external site to fulfil whats required?

I was considering Stripe but they are really for debit/credit card payments etc and we do not allow those for B2B trade clients.

Thanks for any recommendations.
