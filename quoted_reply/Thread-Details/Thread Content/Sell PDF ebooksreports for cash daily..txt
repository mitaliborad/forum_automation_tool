Topic: That’s an interesting method, especially if the content provides real value. I’m curious — are you selling through your own landing pages, or using platforms like Gumroad or Payhip? Also, how do you usually drive traffic to your offers — organic, paid, or social media?

Good idea. I mentioned money dropcards, like this: https://www.realisticdropcard.com/ , to promote your digital products, your website, email list..etc. A QR code on one of those dropcards, or in a direct mail campaign where you're mailing out postcards or a flyer, could work. There are many ways to market your PDF reports or ebooks.

I use all of those methods to market my PDF reports. The PDF report that I sell or sometimes even give away, is the gateway, to my other products, that I am affiliated with. On the PDF report, you're going to have links to your affiliate products, to other digital products that you've produced (other reports), to your landing page, login page for the report's website (You can create a subdomain for each report and ebook that you publish). In the content of your PDF, you can have links to videos that you're hosting on your server or domain. You can get a VPS server for as low as $15 monthly.

The video/s that you link to from your report or ebook, don't require the reader to create an account on the website/resource center/forum/chat/community, that you've set up, but they're invited to do it, and you have a few banner ads at the footer of the page where the video is embeded.

People that are misinformed, think that information products, including PDF reports or ebooks aren't profitable anymore. They think that's "2010" ..."That's so 2008"...But no, it's still a viable, effective way to make money, even today in 2025, you just have to make it as valuable as possible, by connecting other resources to it, like videos, PW protected resource center..etc. You create a community around the report..etc.
