Suggest me more Free and Unlimited Hosting Platforms

Topic: Hi everyone,

I am currently looking for more free and unlimited video hosting platforms to use for my anime and adult website. I have tried many platforms but encountered limitations such as limited upload methods, limited capacity, limited encoding quality, or videos being deleted if there are no views within a certain period of time.

I am looking for platforms with features such as:

- Unlimited storage, support for many upload methods

- Videos not deleted if there are no views (I have about 10k views per day)

- Stable and smooth streaming speed for viewers

- Free, allows 18+ content

Can anyone share with me some good services that you have used or found good?

I am currently using streamp2p to upload anime content and I find it quite good. but they don't accept 18+ content so i want to find some other free hosting platforms to upload 18+ content.

Please give me some suggestions

Thank you everyone so much!

Topic: Honestly, free and unlimited *and* stable for 18+ content is a tough ask. Have you looked into self-hosting with a CDN? Might be cheaper than you think and you'd be in control.

Topic: Free hosts are a no-go. In this day and age, you can get quality paid hosting for literally less than a cup of coffee for small to medium sized sites. There is absolutely no valid reason whatsoever to use a free host in 2025. It's cutting your nose off to spite your face. DON'T DO IT.

Topic: Free and unlimited hosting for 18+ content is rare. Try using Odysee or explore low-cost VPS with PeerTube for more control and fewer restrictions.

Topic: Have you looked into any of the smaller CDNs? They might be more lenient with adult content than the big names, but read their TOS closely.

Topic: would you like some fries with that too?
Maybe my bank account and details?

yes im going to be the dick who says this
decent VPS hosting with those conditions you set is already a gem to find and now you want them for free ontop?
If you are already getting 10k views a day per video.. surely you can invest into a hosting provider

Topic: not many truly free + unlimited ones left that allow 18+ bro. you can try ninjaembed, some still use it for adult stuff. also check mixdrop, streamtape, or voe – they got limits but decent for short term. for long term you might need to rotate or self-host with cheap vps + jwplayer. most free ones purge if inactive.

Are you affiliated??
Trust Pilot doesn’t have good reviews about them

Their first review literraly says
Bad site for business owners

Bad site for business owners, and lots of groups working together to bring down other hosting companies on this forum. Good for reading but don't join it is not a nice place for honest business people.

They are forums like this. I have an account there just like here. I don’t own or sell deals. I don’t own the website nor benefit

Okay, I was hoping that you would suggest a service that has no risk.

I asked upnshare's customer service department and tried it out. I didn't see any storage limitations and since the trial until now I haven't lost any money.
