You can check sites like Botisimo, Streamlabs Cloudbot, or Wizebot for Twitch chatbots. If you're looking for custom chat simulation, some panels offer that, but be careful with TOS violations.

Topic: Honestly, simulating chatters feels kinda hollow. Have you thought about running engaging polls or challenges to organically boost interaction instead?

Just creating a conversation and ranking my stream I do plan on building an organic community for sure, as driving traffic alone would indeed be hollow
