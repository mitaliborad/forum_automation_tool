Hi as you seem experienced in this, can you please tell me about this. I live in a country in Asia where services like Stripe, PayPal is not supported.

So if I move to another country like UAE where both are available. Now, if I form a company in the UAE can I use my UAE company information without problems even if I'm not a citizen. Can it be done this way?
yes you can, u also dont have to move to UAE to form company however you would be required to visit once, UAE company formation is expensive compared to US and UK

Thank you for the guide, I want to try this as Wise recently closed my personal account

Would they ask for a proof of address or the company's address would suffice for that? Also would they ask for a bank statement?
to form a company? no, to open wise etc yes.

Thanks for this guide, I understand that's is from 2022, but now Wise doesn't provide virtual card for LTD or LLC you have to contact them to
they still provide virtual cards as of February 2025

probably stripe doesn't want your business, a company has no affect on the account closure

Topic: Good write-up! Did you find opening an account as "retail not in store" made much of a difference in the Stripe approval process, or do you think that's just a bonus tip?

Categorizing as "retail not in store" helps in getting approval to sites like stripe , basically you can show a shopify store and not many questions will be asked and additional verification in future would become easier
