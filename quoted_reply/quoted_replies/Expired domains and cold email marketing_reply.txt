 Expired domains and cold email marketing


** Original Thread Content: ** 
 I have been wondering with myself buying expired domain name with a strong reputation and at least age factor would it help in cold email marketing?
And where can I get domains like that
What do you guys think please.

 Honestly, I'd skip the expired domain thing; deliverability is a nightmare. Focus on warming up a fresh domain instead, way less hassle in the long run.

 Makes sense too but old domain are important in email deliverability, but yeah warming up new domains is good
