 Video generator


** Original Thread Content: ** 
 So. I have a yt channel whwre i upload 8-12hr asmr type videos. Like rain etc.
Is there any video generator where i could make this from prompts?
Rn what im doing is im using ai to generate a cozy pic and just edit the looping sound by hand and render it.
But it takes so much time to render these out...
Any help?

 Instead of a video generator, have you looked into royalty-free stock footage of rain or nature scenes? Might save you some render time.

 I did look some up on pixaby but the thing is with that site spicificly is that everyone can upload anything... And i read some who got striket becouse on pixa it said its royalty-free but in reality it was someones work...
