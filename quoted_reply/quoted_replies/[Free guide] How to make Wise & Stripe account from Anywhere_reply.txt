 Did you need to do ID verification?

 Good write-up! Did you find opening an account as "retail not in store" made much of a difference in the Stripe approval process, or do you think that's just a bonus tip?


** Quoted Comment: ** 
 Categorizing as "retail not in store"  helps  in getting approval to sites like stripe , basically you can show a shopify store and not many questions will be asked and additional verification in future would become easier
